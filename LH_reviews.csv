452198985;Lufthansa;2;15.01.17;Dec 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Singapore;Frankfurt;3;2;3;1;5;2;1;I can confidently say that for every other airline I've flown with, customer service has been infinitely better than with Lufthansa. The aircraft (new A380) was excellent but customer service was poor. Our tickets were for Premium Economy but I fail to see what additional benefit(s) we incurred over Standard Economy. The service was inferior to standard economy in Singapore Airlines. Cabin staff appeared to be unhappy (hardly a smile from anyone) and more concerned with getting their job done as fast as possible rather than with any notion of customer excellence. The standard of food was inferior in terms of food quality and presentation (in fact dreadful). Lufthansa's boarding procedures both in Singapore and Frankfurt were disorganized, undisciplined and frankly chaotic. Boarding announcements at the gate were inaudible. And they failed to transfer our luggage onto our connecting flights so we had the additional inconvenience of no luggage for 2 days at our destination. Definitely not value for money.
451338524;Lufthansa;3;11.01.17;Jan 17;0;International;Business Class;Bangalore;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;Booked in Premium economy and as they are booked gave a discounted offer for upgrade and I took it... Food is decent and service looked a bit odd compared to other airlines... Boarding process can be a bit smoother . Movies selection is not that great. Did not find so Indian as they advertise....May be they improved from earlier but compared to other options not a great preference
451230306;Lufthansa;3;11.01.17;Dec 16;1;Europe;Economy;Manchester;Frankfurt;4;3;4;3;;;5;We needed to connect in FRA with a longhaul flight. Check in was good and luggage booked right to the next flight. Overall the service was good but somehow it just does not measure up to other lines I fly. Price was OK so that helped.
451118541;Lufthansa;5;10.01.17;Dec 16;1;International;Economy;Hong Kong;Frankfurt;4;4;4;4;4;3;4;The airbus A380 really makes a difference, cabins are more spacious, overall quieter and you don't feel that you're flying as much as on smaller planes.Service was good and there were enough toilets in good condition at the back of the plane. One annoyance is that there are too many announcements, as next to the security announcement in 3 language, the captain will tell the whole plane about all connecting flight and what gate they depart. This should be displayed personally on the entertainment system. No need to tell everybody.
450305293;Lufthansa;5;07.01.17;Dec 16;1;International;Business Class;Vancouver;Frankfurt;5;5;4;5;5;5;4;Wonderful experience. The flight attendants always provided something extra and did everything to make this a great travel experience. We felt really spoiled. Seats were very comfortable. I would have to say the same about the return flight. We are flying Lufthansa frequently and have always had a good experience and it is our preferred airline, service is always impeccable, they are generally on time and we feel in good hands with Lufthansa.

449900564;Lufthansa;1;06.01.17;Jan 17;0;International;Economy;Singapore;Frankfurt;4;2;;;3;2;;LH does it again, managing to destroy a brand new A380. In 2016 not to have a usb charging port, super minimizing the tv screens, having a leaky aircon on top of my window seat, are just the lowlights of my 13h LH flight.
449586024;Lufthansa;5;05.01.17;Dec 16;1;Europe;Economy;Timisoara;Frankfurt;4;5;5;3;3;3;5;Despite the high prices (sometimes) I consider Lufthansa a very good provider because of the delivered services (clean, on schedule, mobile app, good connections, secure, planes).
449082471;Lufthansa;3;03.01.17;Dec 16;1;Domestic;Business Class;Hamburg;Frankfurt;3;3;4;3;3;2;4;Though it was a short haul trip, just about an hour or so, but I did not expect that Economy class seats can be converted to Business class just by removing middle seat. This is what Lufthansa has done to cut cost. So seat comfort is still the same, and all you get is a vacant middle seat. This is equivalent of cheating.Food was ok, so no complaints there.
448803361;Lufthansa;5;03.01.17;Dec 16;1;International;Business Class;Johannesburg;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;5;4;4;We recently flew Lufthansa from South Africa to Germany and return. I can highly recommend the carrier. The crew from check in to in flight were efficient and extremely helpful and friendly. The on board cabin crew went out of their way to ensure our absolute comfort and safety. The meals were first class and flying business class allowed for comfort and space for travelling and sleeping. We arrived feeling fresh and ready for our stay in Germany. We travelled the airline both internationally and locally in country. The levels of service was maintained throughout.
448609041;Lufthansa;4;02.01.17;Dec 16;1;Europe;Economy;Gdansk;Frankfurt;4;5;4;1;2;4;5;Very good service at check in, at boarding and in the plane. The flight was on time and we didn't wait. We were seated on the row nb 3 in front. Only one disapointing topic: the sandwich given which is not a the level of quality expected
448466699;Lufthansa;4;02.01.17;Jul 16;6;International;Economy;Bangalore;Frankfurt;3;5;5;3;3;4;5;Its an above average. Food was not that tasty. But other service was good. When I flew for first time, I got upgraded from Economy to Business class. It was really awesome.
448220571;Lufthansa;4;01.01.17;Jul 16;6;International;Economy;Hong Kong;Frankfurt;4;4;4;3;4;4;4;Nice experience with Lufthansa, efficient and on time. Very comfortable seat and nice staffs. Movie choice is great. Drinks are offered all the time, easy to get water.
448071868;Lufthansa;4;31.12.16;Nov 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Amman;Frankfurt;3;4;4;4;2;4;4;Lufthansa provides efficient, on-time (usually) connections to major European hubs. The flight from Amman to Frankfurt was a 2AM departure, but still the cabin crew offered friendly service along the way, with an above-average breakfast just before our 6AM landing.
447901223;Lufthansa;4;30.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;Delhi;Frankfurt;2;5;4;4;3;4;4;"They just kept serving the drinks no matter what. Glad to leave India (Delhi) and arrived in Frankfurt on time. In fact we arrived early. How is it that ""Star Alliance"" can have Air India in their stable is beyond me."
447797540;Lufthansa;3;30.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;Miami;Frankfurt;4;4;4;4;4;3;3;No second once more.It was a really disappointing flight, we had in Miami a 50-minute delay we have missed our flight from Frankfurt to Amsterdam.We would leave at 9:00 a.m., but have missed our flight to Amsterdam, by the delay in Miami.We got another flight but had to 3.5 hours of waiting. And were given but ‰âÂ 7 per person to spend on the airport that's really pathetic.
447773280;Lufthansa;3;30.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;Plaisance;Frankfurt;5;1;;;4;2;;Its first time I experience this on a long flight. We flew in the morning and we had a 12h fly to Germany with Lufthansa. The crew served us our lunch 2 hours after take off (at about 11 o clock in the morning). The lunch was chicken with rice and salad with fruits. Nothing that can fill you up. After this they served tea and coffee and bottles of water and then they disappear until the last 1,5h before we arrive in Frankfurt!! So they served us dinner. Kids and people were hungry during the flight. Luckily we had some candies and some left overs from the breakfast. I dont get why bothering with the dinner 1,5h before we arrive. Not to mention that we had no option for this. It was literally pasta with a piece of bread and butter and a role in a lunch box. I didnt expect anything like that from Lufthansa. I thought it is a good airline and at least they could go around asking if we are thirsty in such a long flight. It wasnt nighttime, everybody was awaken. Seriously disappointed. The seats are comfy but the plane is old. The funny thing is that accidentally we flew to Mauritius with a low cost airline which made me worried in the beginning. In fact it was much better than this.
447399406;Lufthansa;5;29.12.16;Aug 16;4;Europe;Economy;Dublin;Frankfurt;5;5;;;2;5;;Overall a good experience with Lufthansa no nonsense or problems just on and off the plane as customers would want!The staff were friendly and helpful, if we needed anything it was supplied and the seats were very comfyWill use again 100%
447023289;Lufthansa;4;27.12.16;Dec 16;0;Europe;Economy;London;Frankfurt;5;5;4;3;;4;4;I used Lufthansa on countless occasions throughout the last 10 years.Their planes are usually comfortable, although the legroom can be a bit tight on smaller aircrafts. More often than not are Lufthansa flights delayed or their pilots are on a strike, which caused me some headaches when travelling on business. I would generally recommend Lufthansa, but am a bit annoyed about these inconsistencies.
446816029;Lufthansa;1;26.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;Washington;Frankfurt;1;1;1;1;2;1;2;The flight attendants were very rude and one of the attendants actually told a father of a 2 year old to keep him quiet because it was annoying that he got sick. The food was gross and I will never fly with this airline again.
446647322;Lufthansa;5;25.12.16;Dec 16;0;Europe;Business Class;Oslo;Frankfurt;3;5;;;1;3;;Very friendly and professional staff.Flight was smooth and no complications at all.Breakfast was good- greek yoghurt, choices of bread, variety of cheeses and ham. Most drinks available as well.Enough space for legs and as I had the whole row to myself, had a nice nap.Extra pillow was also available.No complaints, still one of my favorite airlines in Europe!
446553561;Lufthansa;4;25.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Tel-aviv;Frankfurt;4;4;5;3;3;4;5;Safe and on schedule flight. Comfortable seats. Helpful crew and Good service. Acceptable food. Recommended.
446434651;Lufthansa;4;24.12.16;Dec 16;0;Europe;Economy;Venice;Frankfurt;5;5;5;2;3;4;5;This was the first leg of a Venice-Frankfurt, Frankfurt-Shanghai journey. Nothing to complain about, the flight was punctual, and the staff polite, helpful & professional. Lots of leg room compared to the budget flights I'm used to! Only mini-moan was the food, a few biscuits and a drink on a flight around lunch time.
446425288;Lufthansa;5;24.12.16;Oct 16;2;International;Economy;Tel-aviv;Frankfurt;5;5;5;4;4;5;5;We traveled from Tel-Aviv to Frankfurt. Good service, clean and new aircraft. Good space for legs. Nice food.
446297132;Lufthansa;2;23.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Dallas;Frankfurt;4;1;;;4;2;;After a cancelled flight, missing luggage, lack of care, and fifteen hours in the airport before being able to board a plane, I will never consider riding with Lufthansa again. I have never been treated like a disposable nuisance quite as much as today. After Lufthansa lost my emotional support dogs crate and me searching (more like running in every wrong direction in the airport), I nearly broke down in tears because nobody seemed to want or care to help me. A very kind man (the only friendly Lufthansa employee I encountered) noticed I was upset and finally helped me retrieve my missing dog crate. Without him, I'm not sure I would have found it. Without going into too much more detail (because I could go on all day), the icing on the cake was being told that I can not have a cup of water on my connecting flight even though we are sitting (yes I am typing this in the airplane) in a seemingly ongoing delayed flight. I have been traveling for well over 24 hours and don't find it that absurd to ask for one of the most basic human needs. The service is terrible, the employees have an attitude, and I have never felt less like an object in my life.
446176352;Lufthansa;3;22.12.16;Sep 16;3;International;Business Class;Vancouver;Frankfurt;3;3;4;3;3;3;4;I have flown economy on this same flight Vancouver to Frankfurt many many times. i just started booking a business class seat a few years ago and although i do like the space and the comfort of business class....when it comes to the service on the plane i more or less feel like i'm still in economy. yes, the food is better but i guess i just want a few more smiles and attitude of caring from the flight attendants. aren't we all happy to be in this section of the plane? so no complaints really....but i just keep hoping for an attitude that is about 10% better. see you next time Lufthansa!
446170396;Lufthansa;5;22.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Singapore;Frankfurt;4;5;;;5;5;;I have used business class and economy when it comes to overseas flights, so I know the difference. The premium economy of Lufthansa is a perfect middle ground and worth every cent in my opinion. I'm about 1.90m and the legroom was more than enough. I could stretch and actually sleep. Crew was extremely friendly and food was good. Lufthansa is setting a new standard here.
445944461;Lufthansa;4;21.12.16;Oct 16;2;International;Economy;Panama City;Frankfurt;3;5;5;5;5;4;5;It was a long flight, I was flying on economy, the service was fantastic, the seats were as on all econo flights uncomfortable, but the service was great onboard dinner, breakfast, movies, great attention from the flight crew, had no problem with timing or luggage.
445620809;Lufthansa;5;20.12.16;Nov 16;1;International;Business Class;Vancouver;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;5;4;5;Very good experience for a very long flight. Seats open horizantally to make sleep possible. Food good and elegantly served. Staff attentive and smiling. Entertainment console very good (choose from 160 movies!).
444975308;Lufthansa;4;18.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;First Class;Los Angeles;Frankfurt;5;4;5;5;5;3;3;We flew from LA to Frankfurt on Lufthansa's wonderful 380, First Class. High praise, once on board, as you really feel like there are only 8 people on the plane. In many ways, you felt like you were on your own private jet. The seat pods were the best I have experienced while traveling to Europe. Other than Singapore Airlines, these are the most comfortable and well thought-out seats. When the seats were transformed into beds they were very comfortable and I slept 8 hours. I did not eat the wonderful dinner that was offered, preferring to sleep, but it was a world-class menu. Breakfast was individually prepared and was excellent. I love the fact that they don't have overhead bins
444966344;Lufthansa;5;18.12.16;Dec 16;0;Domestic;Economy;Hamburg;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;the check in was perfect. So the nice staff gave me the boarding card until my final destination Phuket. I was surprise because i moved form Lufthansa to Thai. Last time Thai airways in FFM was not will to check the baggage to the final Thai destination so we moved back to Lufthansa and we never will play with other partner
444906021;Lufthansa;3;17.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;Hong Kong;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;Flew on the Airbus A380 (not a comfortable plane) on the upper deck. The arm rest between my wife and I was broken and would only go up half way, which didn't help with the comfort level of the flight. Service from the flight crew was excellent however.
444540419;Lufthansa;1;15.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;San Francisco;Frankfurt;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;Flight was overbooked. We are a family of four, and arrived well in advance, but were put on standby, and got completely separated seats. They did not even try to put us nearby.We travel a lot, and this is the very first time I've had this kind of customer service. Avoid!!!
444532076;Lufthansa;4;15.12.16;Dec 16;0;Europe;Economy;Minsk;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;"I've flown some long haul flights with Lufthansa before and two weeks ago had to fly with them from Cape Town to Munich to Warsaw and back, but as they had a strike on, was rerouted on other airlines. But with this trip, the strike was over and I flew from Frankfurt to Minsk and back. The flights was on a small Embraer E90/95 airplane. Service on-board was good as was check in on both directions.However, what was a bummer was that I had pre-booked seats in both directions and on both occasions I did not get the seats I reserved, so I am at a loss in what's the use of pre-booking"" just to not get what you request. Similarly with meals, but fortunately they had a choice of cake or turkey sandwich to Minsk and cheese or turkey from Minsk, so vegetarians or those with special meal requirements at least had an option"
444342920;Lufthansa;1;14.12.16;Nov 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Sydney;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;Out of 5 flights booked with Lufthansa to and from Europe in November only 1 ended up being a Lufthansa flight. The other four codeshare and they were fine with Singapore Airlines and Czech Air. Our major complaint is that on arrival at Prague Airport to catch our flight to Frankfurt to connect with our flights to Singapore and then Sydney on the same day we found that the Pilots were on strike and had been since the day before!We had NO notification of the strike by email or SMS and therefore no effort all had been made to make alternative travel arrangements for us to get home. It was only due to the efforts of a lovely girl at Prague Airport who managed to get us on to a Czech Air flight to Frankfurt that we were able to finally get onto a Singapore Airlines flight that got us into Singapore in time to connect with their next flight home to Sydney. 16 strikes in 2 years tells you how internally unhappy this airline is and we will never fly with them again. The last thing you need at the end of a holiday when you have commitments back home is to be left uninformed and stranded on the other side of the world. Also, since our return, not one message or apology from Lufthansa for our inconvenience. Says it all!
443624906;Lufthansa;3;11.12.16;Dec 16;0;Europe;Economy;Kiev;Frankfurt;1;2;3;2;1;2;3;I have flown many airlines over the past few years, and have been on 7 lufthansa flights in total. Sadly I think they are following the American airline playbook. The seats are incredibly uncomfortable, and everyone is tightly jammed together. If you never looked at the name on the plane you could be forgiven if you thought United or Delta, or Southwest. This will be another airline I will try to avoid if possible. I think you should look to Canada or the middle east for tips on improving your airline.
443282537;Lufthansa;3;10.12.16;Dec 16;0;Europe;Economy;London;Frankfurt;4;3;;;3;4;;Tried Lufthansa as a change from British Airways who seem to have lost the plot! Overall much better than BA, but spoilt it by changing our seats on the return from close to the front to the very back and not telling us. However you can choose seats on booking and free food and drink.
443036241;Lufthansa;5;09.12.16;Oct 16;2;Domestic;Economy;Berlin;Frankfurt;4;5;5;4;4;4;5;Everything - since the beginning till the end was just perfect. Great service, smiling crew, a lot of space for legs.
442973428;Lufthansa;4;08.12.16;Nov 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Orlando;Frankfurt;4;5;4;5;5;5;5;Flight was on time and great service from Stewarts. Multiple drinking services including wine, two meals that were actually decent and a great selection of movie options for a long flight. More leg room was nice for the longer flight and upgrade to premium economy was reasonable. Requested handicap assistance and airline had someone at check-in, at gate to change flights, and to assist with customs - great service provided free and wouldn't take tips.
442822962;Lufthansa;1;08.12.16;Nov 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Johannesburg;Frankfurt;2;1;2;1;2;1;1;"After being on a train trip in SA with no internet/mobile communication we came to Jburg for check-in and was met by the message strike and cancelled flight. Can happen, BUT we were also met by a totally unprepared rebooking alternative for our flight. A return flight to Frankfurt we booked and paid for more than 6 months ago. The check-in people started to browse for an hour and came to (as they said) booked seat on another airline. We were sent to another terminal, queuing and just met by ""No, they haven't booked you, you are on a waiting list. Come back within two hours and we'll see..."".Went back to LH desk new browsing (little or no information...) after another hour booked on another airline. Went there, ""No, we have not got the necessary information from LH, wait here..."". Another, very nervous waiting for us and just before closing we got thru.We can understand cancelled flight, but not the not prepared alternative route and some at least preliminary bookings or at least a concise and well managed acting with us in focus and informed and rightly informed all the time. We had to chase people, information, terminals and what have you. The LH staff more or less didn't notice we were anxious people, more trying to find ways foe some ""parcel distribution"" or what have you?We certainly will do our outmost to choose other carriers in the coming."
442025096;Lufthansa;3;04.12.16;Dec 16;0;Europe;Economy;London;Frankfurt;3;3;;;3;3;;There isn't a lot to distinguish between the main airlines on shorthand flights. My short hop from Heathrow to Frankfurt was fine but nothing special. While we took off 15 minutes late we made up the time on route. Staff were courtious if not overly friendly, but efficient as you would expect. The inflight snack was a rather German sandwich which could have been better, but this is only a minor gripe. Overall I prefer BA, but would use Lufthansa again if the flight times are more convenient.
441866733;Lufthansa;4;03.12.16;Nov 16;1;Europe;Economy;Rome;Frankfurt;3;4;3;3;;3;4;Quite good flight, as usual. In time flight, space for legs enough for a flight lasting around 1h. Useful for international connections because youf arrival finger will be at the main area of the FRA airport.

Its really glorified economy class with seats not reclining at all, nowhere to hang your jacket and staff with attitude. No tv screens and no tablets given outWill not fly with them again
441830844;Lufthansa;4;03.12.16;Aug 16;4;Europe;Economy;Riga;Frankfurt;3;5;5;4;1;5;5;New aircraft, very clean, they give a sandwich and some drinks during the flight, that was amazing because nowadays is very rare in european flights. The seat are not so comfortable but for 2 hours it's enough.
441775845;Lufthansa;5;03.12.16;Nov 16;1;International;Economy;Detroit;Frankfurt;5;5;4;5;4;4;5;A great flight from start to finish. The airplane left on time, was an Airbus A330 with nice comfortable seats. Staff were extremely friendly and courteous, food and drink service and quality were excellent.

441745113;Lufthansa;1;03.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;Shanghai;Frankfurt;1;1;5;1;4;3;1;unfriendly and unhelpful Team on board. I fly at least 6 times intercontinental and at least 30 domestic flights.The latest flight was the worst with Lufthansa.
441625746;Lufthansa;1;02.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;Toronto;Frankfurt;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;the worse airline ever we book with Lufthansa on 1st Dec 2016 after waiting 3 hours inside the plane they canceled they told us it will be for 04:30 next day and we went there on 01:30 and again waiting long time inside the plane and the flight departed at 6:15 I dont know why these people are lying and plus there plane are too old uncomfortable and bad service .that why they have on November 2016 four cancellations all lairs every one there lying they dont care about people they dont have humanity only try how to sale ticket as much as they can shem on you Lufthansa from drooping down from big airline to cheat people shame on you and shame on you Lufthansa not recommend at all

No fast track through security. No fast track for boarding.

440764358;Lufthansa;4;28.11.16;Apr 16;7;International;Economy;Newark;Frankfurt;3;3;3;4;4;3;3;It was a big jet and a tight squeeze. Not sure I'd like to fly on such a large plane again, given a choice, since I felt like a sardine, even on an end seat in the middle section. Sleeping was not an option, unfortunately, considering how long the flight was. The way the cabin is set up, sound just ping pongs around, so it's always sort of loud. The flight attendants were very pleasant though. The warm, damp towel was nice, as was the complimentary after dinner drink.
440476395;Lufthansa;4;27.11.16;Sep 16;2;International;Economy;Chicago;Frankfurt;3;5;5;5;5;4;5;Flew from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Frankfurt (FRA) on flight LH431, which was a redeye flight that leaves around 4 PM and arrives the following day around 7:15 AM. All in all, the flight was on-time, check-in/boarding process was smooth, flight attendants were very nice and helpful, food was great, and the flight was smooth.With that being said, the economy seats are a bit lacking in terms of comfort, especially for a red-eye. I was seated in Seat # 30F, which is a middle seat in the middle section of the aircraft. It is hard to get any sleep due to the lack of seat recline, legroom, and width. It was made even more impossible when the people sitting next to me were watching movies on the in-flight entertainment system literally the entire flight. Next time, I will definitely opt for an aisle or window seat or splurge for premium economy as to try and get a little extra room and avoid people watching IFE.As for the other aspects of the flight, they were great. I was able to pre-order a gluten-free dinner online in advance. That's a nice feature as other airlines (e.g., American, United) requires having to call their customer service number. While that's not difficult, sometimes that means having to wait at least 15 minutes to speak with a representative. Lufthansa runs a good operation and would definitely fly again.

However the business class seat was uncomfortable and far too narrow to provide a positive experience. When compared to the seat and service available on Cathay, Emirates, Singapore and even BA on some of their planes the business seat on LH ranks at the bottom. As much as they indicate you can lie flat, the space for an average sized man is much too narrow so your arms ends up in all sorts of bad positions. Ended up having to sleep partially sitting up.

The flight crews are always very professional and friendly. One could always ask for better inflight food being in economy, since serving a 'muffin cake' is not really a healthy option.
436726440;Lufthansa;3;12.11.16;Nov 16;0;International;Business Class;Osaka;Frankfurt;3;3;;;4;3;;Having had experienced various airlines on multiple trips to and from Japan (Tokyo and Osaka), Lufthansa's business class doesn't score high.In brief: The overal experience ranges greatly from flight to flight. All European flight attendants are correct but rather stiff and unflexible service-wise. Their enthusiasm and attention decreases with every advancing towards the rear row.Chairs, although fully reclining/flat, are not that comfortable and on a narrow side.Food is *very* average. Offering the most mainstream orange juice from a tetrapack isn't exactly a superiour experience. Espresso is served, but that's about it: no variation of any kind, no latte, nor macchiato, for example. Alcohol menu was good, if you care for that.If you have dietary restrictions, be prepared to be served half of what a regular passenger would be offered, get about the same very meals served 2x throughout the entire flight (fruit salad over and over again), and forget about any snacks or an extra bun...The Japanese menu was better, but the Western menu was flat as a brick. Desserts were below any level: apart from the tarte tatin, the rest was not worth mentioning. The cheese plate was also trivial and unsatisfactory taste-wise, and one single dried apricot accompanying the cheese bites felt comical.On the positive side: Lufthansa's complementary travel purse was ok - if you care for that. The blanket was cotton padded, and the Bose headphones were a joy to use. Good airport lounges must be noted, although very well visited/crowded. And Lufthansa's proverbial punctuality remains its core asset.All in all, given the choice, I'd opt for one of the Japanese airlines, which are *way* above anyone else on this segment. Then, the Swiss business class, or even Finnair. In business class, Lufthansa offers the bare minimum, focussing on the First class instead, which should not be mutually exlusive. With all due respect, Lufthansa, it's time to learn from your South East Asian competitors what supreme and customer-centered service is.
436172193;Lufthansa;4;10.11.16;Jan 16;10;International;Economy;Miami;Frankfurt;1;4;4;4;5;3;4;A pretty good flight. On time. Good service. Acceptable food. The Germans must have butts like rocks as the seat was sooo hard that my butt was in pain for almost all the trip.The only relief was to put the pillows on the seat and that was only temporary as the pillows were quite small.
435998853;Lufthansa;3;09.11.16;Oct 16;1;International;Economy;Orlando;Frankfurt;2;4;2;1;3;3;2;Alright, it was economy class and I deserve what I get, right? Well, I don't think so. This flight was purchased by my foreign client and I had little ability to modify much other than my economy seat assignment. As a Gold Star Alliance member (on United), I was hoping I could upgrade my seat. Could not online or at the counter. Though I had an emergency exit row seat, with no seat in front of me, my seat was horribly uncomfortable. There was no back support and the fixed arms dug into my hips... a day later I was very bruised on both hips... (Several flights from Ft Meyers to Dubai, with the exception of Ft Myers to Orlando all on Lufthansa.). The seat was torn, worn out, and just downright miserable.The flight crew was delightful. The food sucked. So, crappy food with a smile is still crappy food. The upside is Frankfurt has options to eat upon arrival. Lufthansa has gone the same direction as many US carriers... cut overhead by reducing the quality of the experience. I have flown on them for over 4 decades... and they have lost the charm they use to have. BTW, I looked at the business section, not all that impressive either...
435769739;Lufthansa;2;09.11.16;Apr 16;7;Europe;Business Class;Malta;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;My return flight from Luqa/Malta to Frankfurt/Germany was cancelled without warning or notification whatsoever.As usual, I tried to do the web check in the day before on the LH Website the flight would not pop up. Trying to call LH Malta offices was a fruitless undertaking which I gave up after 1 hour holding on. Thereafter, I tried to call the LH Frankfurt help line after 55 minutes my prepaid sim card ran out of money so I gave up. Getting back to the Apartment I tried the LH website once more and I learned many flights had been cancelled due to a pending Airport staff strike - but still no notification. I had to change my flight for the same day ie a day earlier then planned. I had a flight 2 days later to Bangalore via Dubai thus I need to get to Frankfurt. No hotel rooms available in and around Frankfurt either car hire prices had escalated - I had to drive 100km for an 2 night stay till my flight was leaving for Bangalore.Now, I can understand everything, but why on earth does LH have all my contact details, phone numbers email id's etc and when they can make usde of it they dont use it, but bombard one with promotional and other gumpf constantly. This, chaps from LH, is not what I would expect from a so called world class carrier as LH. Catch a wake up and look after your customers properly statement comes to mind!

The audio on the plane's announcement apparatus is terrible...could not hear much, and the German accent of English didn't help either.Tip - if you are changing planes (like we did to Zurich) give enough time. As old people running through Passport review, Security checks, and moving from one end of the terminal to the other, almost killed us! We had about an hour.

There is no separation of the cabin... the welcome juice is horrible,..I asked for water and they told me that only after take off... really?? Food was disgusting..was like prepared for Air China... at the end only the bread and part of the breakfast. Order for Spakling wine and I was expecting for at least Prossecco, but they brought me this acid cheap sparkling wine that I had to say something. Very dissapointed for this service..very similar to the poor PE from AC or SK. The only real PE in Europe are offered by VS, AF and AZ. Not even BA.. They keep crying out for the gulf carriers.. well.. EK, EY and QR offer much better service in regular economy. Sorry LH... you are going thru the wrong path..and don't say that we didn't warned.

Quiet, serene and wonderful service, as usual. On thereturn I had the same great service. Upper deck again, only 8 people on this flight andit was so very quiet. Slept on the way back, just wonderful. The help I received from allthe staff and ground crew was great, I had a ride on the golf cart, straight through customs and security, no waiting. Connection was tight so did not go to the Lounge, no matter not important. I will always fly with them when going to Europe. Worth every penny I paid.

Well that was a farce all the numbers were auotmated couldnt talk to anyone - away for 5 weeks with no baggage. Finally got a call from my home town airport 3 weeks later to tell me my bag had arrived.

It was an overnight flight and we were served breakfast later than Singapore Airlines does so had more time to sleep. The landing announcements were also more efficient and shorter, so we could finish the last episode of TV we were watching. Great inflight shopping options. I liked 2 things and told the crew. They handed them to me before breakfast so I had some time to decide. I bought a Daniel Wellington watch, an upcoming brand that I am v impressed by. Very good price.The photograph is (strangely) of the bathroom, but its there as there is a window! have seen this only the second time and my kids love it somehow.

The interior of the aircraft was immaculate and it appeared to be new. I was fortunate not to have a passenger beside me. The seating configuration is herringbone pattern. I would have liked to have been explained how things worked as when I woke in the dark I had no idea how to turn on the screen or find the headset. A meal was served shortly after takeoff but I was too tired and put my seat into flat bed mode and slept. I was comfortable but the seats are narrow. I would have expected a German airline to have wider seats. My flight attendant was very friendly and obliging. When I found the headset it was already plugged in and ready for use. That is the first time I have ever used an airline headset that did not come in a sealed plastic bag. I did wonder if they were ever removed and cleaned. Breakfast was good. As we were late I missed my connection to Rome but was immediately rebooked on the next flight and my luggage made it as well.

The on-board service is excellent. Everything works. the Service desk people at the airports are there to actually help you. If something goes wrong in scheduling, they do far more than they have to in order for things to work out. I wouldn't consider flying anyone else.

432111271;Lufthansa;2;27.10.16;Oct 16;0;International;Economy;Hong Kong;Frankfurt;2;2;;;1;2;;Flew out from HK for a business meeting in Germany.Outbound plane, an A380 was delayed by a technical problem with the breaking system for 4 hours. Arrived substantially delayed and missed my connecting flight. Connecting flight was then delayed by an hour because overnight maintenance on the regional jet (also Lufthansa) had overrun - with the effect that I missed most of my first day in Germany and had to cancel important meeting.Return flight from Frankfurt to Hong Kong started with disorganised remote boarding of the A380 service aircraft. We were rushed to board the busses and we're then kept waiting in the bus for approximately 25 minutes outside the aircraft. The purser was courteous to offer an explanation and apology for the boarding fiasco.Food was disappointing (no main course choice) have had better on domestic Chinese airlines.Cabin attendant serving me seemed to be having a bad day and was therefore unpleasant.A thoroughly bad experience with 3 out of 4 Lufthansa services being substandard in the space of 4 days.Overall impression - Lufthansa lacks respect for its customers.
432029184;Lufthansa;1;26.10.16;Oct 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Bangkok;Frankfurt;2;3;4;3;3;4;1;"Errors happen, but when they do who ever is responsible should try to correct them. After bording the flight out of Bangkok last night going to Copenhagen for important meetings we were informed that some defect had happen to the flight and we had to wait for fixing. It took just over 1 hours. I was traveling alone as this is a swift business-trip but I still surely do not mind some comfort. The desire for comfort is why I purchased a PREMIUM ECONOMY ticket. I could easily have gotten an ECONOMY ticket DIRECTLY to Copenhagen but with the short layover and ""only"" 100% more for better seat and service with PREMIUM on LUFTHANSA I took the chance. BIG MISTAKE. It's not the defect with the plane that is the problem it's the service after arriving in Frankfurt. Firstly I had 30 min to try to reach the connecting flight but no efforts from ground staff was done to at least try. Secondly we were taken outside in 5 degrees (freezing when used to 30 degrees) and no jacket. Never mind, the bus was fairly fast to the check of passport and documents. Finally I got the the service center and very calm and easy I explained that I had some important business in Copenhagen but instead of putting me on the first flight LUFTHANSA was more concerned about their own economy and put me on the next of their own flights. - Over 2 hours delay, but again I did not get upset by it. I talked very nicely and friendly with the lady at the counter and when I explained that I needed to get online and cancel my meetings in Denmark she could not help me to acces the business lounge. OK!! ""well, can I pay to get it I said"" Oh yes sure it will cost ‰âÂ25 she said (maybe it was ‰âÂ35 cant remember) She did give me a ‰âÂ5 for coffee but it seams a rather small compensation knowing what I was missing and what I planned for over the last 2 month. Now, I arrived to the business lounge 5 minutes later and was rejected by the security. I ""only"" had a PREMIUM E. ticket remember. I said ""no problem here is my creditcard just put the entrance on there. NO was the answer. No Business ticket NO acces. OK, so now I'm left with lost business deals sitting on a over crowded cafÌ© where internet is barely working and I'm trying to get in touch with people waiting for me. The ‰âÂ5 voucher for coffee I left in the garbage can and soon I will be leaving Germany and LUFTHANSA never to retur. At least not to LUFTHANSA!!!!! The cost for saving an unfortunate incident wound maybe have been ‰âÂ20 for LUFTHANSA but instead they were more low-fare/ cheap mainstream than Norwegian. :-) The good news is that it can only get better from here onwards... Have a fantastic day and in order to keep it fantastic book somewhere else that LUFTHANSA."

United States airlines could learn alot about the proper way to treat customers. Every flight attendant is friendly and helpful.

Delicious and abundant food, not just a bag of pretzels TV at every seat with free headphones,with a variety of movies, TV shows or music..
431386456;Lufthansa;4;24.10.16;Oct 16;0;International;Business Class;Addis Ababa;Frankfurt;5;5;5;3;4;3;4;I was able to check in online for this flight and got the unfortunate news that my return home to Germany from Addis Ababa would, indeed, include an overnight connection via Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.The segment to Jeddah was relatively trouble free. I had an aisle seat in Business Class just behind the curtain to First Class. There was ample leg room and fortunately the seat folded down to a flat bed. The entertainment system was working well with a reasonable choice of things to keep one busy. One of the cabin crew was a very friendly and bubbly English lady who did her very best to make the flight as comfortable as possible. She apologised profusely that she couldn't serve me champagne prior to take off because we would be flying to Saudi Arabia. So I was positivley surprised when she brought me a glass as soon as we reached cruising altitude. And wine was served with dinner. The most annoying thing about this connection is the fact that you are all woken up ca. 3 hours into the flight to land, refuel and take off again at Jeddah at some god awful hour in the morning. Being awoken from a pretty deep sleep was irritating to say the least. I did appreciate the help of the cabin crew when my Smartphone disappeared down into the bowels of the complex seat system. Two ladies came and almost took the seat apart to locate my phone without damaging it. For that I was extremely grateful. Arrival in Frankfurt was fine - ahead of schedule. And my luggage was directed through to the area close to the ICE fast train connection so that I didn't have to drag it far to catch my train connection to Cologne. All in all, a pleasant experience apart from the highly annoying stop off in Saudi...

When there are a lot of passengers , sometimes (I hope) security forgets to fix tag to you bag, as happened to me. The matter is, that at the entrance to the plane those tags are checked by airlines personnel and in case you don't have one, - you are not allowed to enter the plane!!! Then security officers are asked to come to the lounge and all content of your bag is checked in front of all other passengers, - no privacy! I nearly lost my plane, despite the fact that I was flying business class. Lufthanza personnel explained, that such are airport security procedures and they can't do anything. Very unpleasant experience. So, while in Delhi - be aware of those tags already at the stage of security check:)

But first, ,grabbing the luggage-- which should have been easy. My handicapped wheelchair escort. (I am the disabled one) told me that my very visible luggage should be among the first bags out. After all, We had marked each bag with penguin duct tape and used silver Mylar for our name tags.One bag came right out. But it wasn't mine. Two hours later we put in a claim with lost luggage who handed me a plastic zipper bag with a few necessities inside, including a white tee shirt. I worried I'd have no clothing for the whole trip! But I needn't have worried. Lufthansa delivered my luggage the following night, penguin tape and all.

So I went to the gate and they said that the Frankfurt counter must be working on my reservation because it was locked. So I wait for 3 hrs in the Denver airport. When I went to board they told me that since I would miss my connection in Frankfurt and there wasn't another one available that day, I would have to stay in Denver until tomorrow to take the same itinerary one day later. Oh and I would have to fly economy because there were no business class seats available. Oh and they wouldn't put me up in the Westin at the airport, that would be too convenient, I would have to wait an hour for them to pull my bag off the flight and then wait for a shuttle to the Red Lion hotel, a super cheap motel without even a restaurant. So, why couldn't someone have called and told me or at least sent me an email so that I didn't spend 5 hours in the airport? Lufthansa thinks nothing of your time and doesn't lift a finger to proactively rebook their customers when flights are delayed. I will never fly Lufthansa again and am telling everyone I know.

Modern aeroplanes ( Airbus 480 has now been superseded by the Boeing 747-800) with no quibble if you want an extra beer , good choice of food, plenty to watch in the small screen and polite friendly aircrew.

The service was extremely friendly and accommodating on each of the crossings. Lots to choose from in state-of-the-art media.That said, last year we flew Air France p.e. and in stark contrast at the terminal, p.e. is given preferential treatment for check-in ( with business and first class) and boarding (same). Was very surprised that Lufthansa did not offer the same accommodation.Other than this discrepancy, both carriers offer augmented comfort on board.

Since my 2 dogs are pugs (And virtually inseparable) they said I could use an XL crate and put both of them in there as long as they both could turn and fit comfortably!

To top it all, the ""bed"" is not really flat, and the feet are meant to go into a little niche, separated from the feet of the neighbor by only a thin wall. This is really not up to standards. On the other hand, the entertainment system offers a good choice, and wifi is available (did not use it). The food was average, the beef not really tender (what a difference to even simple restaurants in the country this flight departed) and the salad was obviously not fresh. What is really great is the Senator lounge in Frankfurt airport (did not use the lounge in Rio)."

They just did what they had to and nothing more. The food was terrible so, I didn't eat much.

Only ""disappointment"" was boarding in FRA for return: apart from First and Business Class, the boarding for PE and Y was a free for all - not even any attempt at boarding by row number. With 300+ pax in an A380 this led to ridiculous crowding. So much for legendary Germanic order and efficiency!LH Y FRA-EDI <2hours. A321. Intra-Europe really means a domestic flight. No frills and pax packed like sardines. Just another commuter bus trip.LH Y CAI-FRA - Economy. Brand new A321 which might be primarily intended for domestic flights since there was no entertainment service on board. Apparently Lufthansa is introducing, just on this aircraft, a wifi film service to those in the know and who had previously downloaded their special new app. Tough luck for all passengers who hadn't been told in advance or who didn't have a suitable device (and one fully charged since there were no USB chargers!). Walking back through the cabin to the toilets I saw practically no passengers accessing the new service. For a 4h 30 international flight, from one continent to another, the absence of on-board entertainment seemed pretty poor really. The cabin staff were all professional, pleasant and bilingual.

Based on our experience we would have no hesitation in flying with Luftjhansa in the future. (I further endorse the above comments as our return flight in October was of a similar standard).

But, there a few things that starts to bother when travelling a lot. For one, we are looking for the best price, naturally, however, the modern concept of selling everything possible to make a buck, takes away from the overall great experience. Dividing economy in sub-classes, seems like added torture, with price differences of up to 50%. Changing seats before 24hs, extra-pay. Got the lowest fare, you also will get the lowest mileage accumulation!!! That hurts! A lot!I just committed the mistake to change my seats within economy class without knowing the details for this 747-800. The computer placed my on seat 48G, all the way back, and when I discovered a seat during my online check-in 24hs prior to boarding, in the front (19A), of course I jumped on it. Little did I know that this was the beginning of a nightmarish 12 hour flight to Frankfurt. I am not the smallest person, but oh brother, I either grew more than I thought, or the planes really got that tinny! And to top it off, under my front seat was a box installed that didn't allow for any stretching of my legs. When my frontman decided to tilt the recliner, my food disappeared. Needless to say, 12 hours in such a confinement shouldn't even be allowed! For a healthier return (mentally as much as physically) I was lucky enough to still find an seat with more leg room, for an extra charge, of course! About 25% of the original fare.Things changed dramatically since I started to travel about 20 years ago, and not for the better, from a client's perspective.Oh, by the way, for the geeks, I didn't like much the LH's inflight route map monitoring concept, but enjoyed the external life-cams ...

My most recent experience was not the greatest, and I'm not saying that because I'm comparing it to my other trips which were on a higher class. First of all, I had a seat selected online and I even showed the person at the front desk the seat I've selected on my phone. But the system did not show that I had reserved that seat and that seat was given to someone else by the time I got to the airport. The flight was full, so instead I was given a seat that is literally right beside the bathroom door. I told them that it is not my fault and I do not wish to spend the next 6+hrs sitting there so either they assign me my seat back or upgrade my ticket. They didn't do either. The seat I was given was not the kind of seat that is on the last row before the bathrooms, this one was literally right beside the door, something I've never seen to be honest. It was extremely uncomfortable and made my flight unpleasant. I was not able to sleep or simple relax because i constantly had people rubbing against and hitting me as they needed to go in or out of the bathroom.

The meal was served and 15 minutes later the drink was offered. Lufthansa is fast becoming not much better than the low cost airlines only without the price break. I question whether or not their high price is worth what they offer. By the way I have a Silver Frequent Flyer Miles and More Card and have watched their prices inflate while their strikes have left us stranded and the on board service is minimal.

Well we sat in middle seats halfway back. Once we were seated 4big guys sat in front of us and as soon as they could they reclined their seats. And they stayed that way the entire trip. This made our space even more minimal. This made our entire flight uncomfortable. Not to mention the food was terrible, and the flight attendants were rather cool to us fliers.
424101097;Lufthansa;4;01.10.16;Sep 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Miami;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;4;5;5;Service was excellent in that the flight attendants were responsive to needs and friendly (spoke many languages in accomodating their passengers). We paid more and in turn, received more: glassware, eating utensils, more legroom and comfort amenities such as earplugs, eye masks, socks, etc. TV's were at every seat. The only negative comment we can give was that when the seat in front of you was put in a full recline position, it limited/impinged on your space making it difficult to exit your space.

The Asiana lounge in Seoul was ok, a little bit crowded but all in all what can be expected. I sat in the seat 12A which turned out to be a mistake again. It seems like the beginner hostesses gets this row on the a380. She was definitely over ""swamped"" so the service was not what one is used to in business. I believe that if you go for the seats on the right side of the plane you have a better service. small funny thing: The seat cushion firmness lights were connected to the passenger in the seat next to me and not to my own. The water in the toilet was not working for most part of the trip. The lounge at Frankfurt was just too full, there were no seats available for us in the entire lounge, so we had no choice but to leave. Nah, this time Lufthansa did all in all not deliver in their business class experience."
424010864;Lufthansa;5;01.10.16;Sep 16;1;International;Economy;Philadelphia;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;Reviewed online sites, elected to book direct through United/Lufthansa for non stop direct flight and received best advertised price anywhere. Airbus aircraft economy seats were comfortable and sufficiently roomy for the 8 hr flight. Crew were very efficient and attentive to passengers. A vacation trip for which the flight each way was part of the vacation experience.

In the airport they should have a better space to board, because the airline is awsome, but the space in the airport to board is not that good!

Leg room was so small that vit was imposible to leave your seat during a 20 hrs night flightTHe offered food was like the content of a baby nappy. Did not dare to try it.
423782031;Lufthansa;2;30.09.16;Sep 16;0;Europe;Economy;Amsterdam;Frankfurt;2;1;3;1;1;2;1;The time table of Lufthansa for many European destinations in not good at all. Their time between arrival and departure in Amsterdam is very short and delayed arrival causes several other consecutive problems. They arrived 40 minutes late and, consequently, departed from Amsterdam 50 minutes late. Ground operations are performed by Avia Partner, an agent that gave a wrong information that the departure will be only 15 minutes delayed, what was not realistic. Particularly bad places in economy were give to Gold card members (Senators). Due to that fact, the crew was unable to deliver even a glas of water to most passengers, including premium passengers during 90 minutes time from boarding to arrival. Both Avia Partner staff and crew should complete lack of interest for passengers.

Driving is the same, but you take your chance on traffic.Lufthansa service itself is top. The A319 is a cattle car like all others, but for short hops we're not expecting luxury on the flight.

Service onboard, food and the entertainment system were on the good side of average, but not enough to consider them very good"

At the gate we were given two seats, 29J and 41B, several rows apart and on opposites sides of aircraft for this long journey and rudely told, ""at least you have seats!!!!!"" Service was poor from gate to arrival. I have been flying for 48 years, since 1968, and this was by far my worst experience. Throughout my three week stay in South Africa, I could NOT stop dreading my return flights on this airline. My dread became a nightmare reality, because the return was just as bad!!!!"

423482882;Lufthansa;4;29.09.16;Aug 16;1;International;Economy;Tampa;Frankfurt;3;5;4;5;5;2;5;Plain and simple, I hate the Airbus A340 that they used on both legs (RT) flight. There is NO, NOT, ANY AC vent to direct any air onto the passengers. Therefore the entire cabin was way too hot and uncomfortable. POOR DESIGN ON AIRBUS and Lufthansa's part for allowing this to happen. Next time, I'll be looking at BAW from Tampa to London then make my connection there, and fly in a Boeing 777 which is much more comfortable. The ONLY Place that was comfortable on the Lufthansa flight was the gallery where the crew had it made and the curtains were closed. They apologized and said hang out for a bit. As well as the crew was great and treated the passengers with respect. But Airbus has a flying oven.

423370738;Lufthansa;3;28.09.16;Sep 16;0;Europe;Economy;Krakow;Frankfurt;3;5;5;3;3;3;1;8 hour delay !! Compounded by the fact the Luftansa had the flight on hold so that all of those with connecting flights were effectively blocked from trying to reschedule subsequent connecting flights. Passengers who were not connecting were immediately rebooked on alternative earlier flights. Those with international connections had to wait in a 3+ hour line to reschedule at a separate desk. By the time our turn came, all alternative flights out of Krakow were taken. The majority of those with connecting flights missed their cdonnections. There was no attempt to triage the mess. Zero stars for the Krakow service. Because Luftansa had the flight on some sort of technical hold none of us could rebook on our own. There was no surprise in the delay as Luftansa knew they had to fly in a mechanic to certify the repair. Most passengers with connecting flights wound up overnighting in Frankfort.However five stars to Krisitinia at Luftansa's transfer desk in Frankfort who managed to get us rebooked in a huge rush to just make that days' last connecting flight to North America (and last two seats on two separate flights) on two different airlines back home so we only arrived 12 hour late and not the 24 hour delay the Krakow staff had us rebooked on. The actual flight from Krakow to Frankfort was fine.

The meals are pretty good and the entertainment selection is outstanding. The only slight complaint is the legroom is minimal, but that is the story of every airline today as they try to squeeze every possible seat into the same space.
423361101;Lufthansa;4;28.09.16;Oct 15;11;International;Premium Economy;Orlando;Frankfurt;5;4;4;3;4;4;2;I was bumped from Premium Economy to Business on this flight. The service was nice, what you expect from Business class. The only issue I had on this flight is that I was pulled away from boarding and made to stand to the side until the entire plane was boarded, without any explanation. Once there were no passengers left, they told me I was bumped up, and by the time they allowed me in the cabin, all the lights were dimmed, I had a hard time getting situated in the dark. I would always choose Business or Premium Economy with Lufthansa if at all possible on these long flights, the comfort with Lufthansa is well worth it.
423318745;Lufthansa;4;28.09.16;Jun 16;3;International;Economy;Shanghai;Frankfurt;4;5;3;4;4;4;3;This airline is very professional. Everything worked out well.

Actually, not too many company had firm precise written policy on service dog. A few Air Line company had very unreasonable requirements in very short period of time. However, Alaskan Air Line and Lufthansa Air Line had precise written requirements in web site, so customers will understand necessary documents and shots which dog needs. It was very smooth check-in at LAX and Frankfurt International Air Port. In matter of fact they check in with priority status so we do not have to wait for long line.Furthermore, when we coming back from Frankfurt, we rode Air Bus 380, largest air plain in the world, seats was so roomy and comfortable.

The design of the seats allow for no leg room, no side room and they allow for no personal space and not much padding on the seats. If the person in front wants to recline, they are in your face. This was an international flight which was over 8 hours!!! It was very verry uncomfortable! The flight from Frankfort to Belgrade had more leg room and it was less than 2 hours! I personally think every Lufthansa employee should be made to take a flight of more than 8 hours and return. Then they would redesign the seating. I will NEVER take Lufthansa again! The worst flight I have ever taken and I have flown all over the world."

Planes are clean, comfortable and flight attendants are friendly and helpful. Flying economy class is comfortable. You always get a pillow, blanket and bottle water for the flight. The seats have lumbar for your lower back and can recline pretty far back. There is plenty of leg room to stretch out for the average person. If you are over 6 feet you might want to consider premium economy or business class. Only time you feel cramped is if the person in front fully reclines their seat and you have not done the same. Meals are great! You actually get edible food. And the attendants throughout the flight are serving juice, water, coffee, wine and spirits for you to enjoy, No extra charge! There are monitors on the seat in front of you, so you can watch movies or TV shows for the long journey. Price might be a little higher that other airlines but it‰Ûªs worth it!

In Frankfurt, we had quite a hike (with little guidance) to the pre-arranged bus that would transport us to Strasbourg. We were thankful for a bus driver that was willing to wait for us.

I was running late for my flight because of a bag disaster by another airline a few days earlier. I was technically 5-10 minutes too late to check my bag but the agent put it through anyway with priority and said it would make the flight, which it did. When I got to security the line was very long. I mentioned my flight was just starting to board, showed them my boarding pass and asked if there was a shorter line (hoping for something similar to a TSA Pre-Check line or Priority/First class line. Even better, they announced to other security personnel that I was late and put me at the very front of the line.At the gate, the arriving flight was 30 minutes late so we were delayed in boarding. But they scanned boarding passes and boarded so efficiently we only left 5 minutes late. The last person walked on the plane, the doors closed, and we pushed back before the last person even got to their seat. Drink/snack service began 10 minutes into the flight, long before reaching cruising altitude.It was a short regional flight so it was an all-economy plane, but it had regular legroom and comfort. Some airlines cram you in like sardines for the short flights.Overall impressed with the efficiency and customer service of Lufthansa and it was a good, comfortable, uneventful flight. And my bag arrived at the bag carousel 10 minutes later.

I think the airlines are adding seats but taking away leg room.We think that the airlines should consider doing away with the reclining seats. It isn't any more comfortable as it doesn't really recline that much. However,...it makes it less comfortable for the person seated behind. The person in front of me reclined as soon as we were in the air, and never returned the seat to normal. We had to ask him to lift the seat back up so we could eat!! I could go on and on. The only plus was the food was ok.
423235890;Lufthansa;4;28.09.16;Jul 16;2;International;Economy;Los Angeles;Frankfurt;3;4;4;3;3;4;4;Went economy all the way, no special seats, which is probably how most people travel. Check in and arrival were fine. No delays or hassles. Good service on board, with plenty of drinks, water, snacks, and meals. Limited but ultimately okay in-flight entertainment (no one can match Virgin for entertainment, so maybe I feel a bit spoiled for choices).

There was a TV with numerous shows available, including seasons of HBO. I watched Curb Your Enthusiasm and BIllions. The food was quite good for an airline, I got a bacon wrapped filet which I enjoyed.

I really like most Star Alliance companies, and I had high expectations, as this is a German company, and I've had nothing but great experiences with German hospitality. The boarding process was super disorganized. The plane was so incredibly cramped, I couldn't believe it. VERY uncomfortable. We asked for help for a broken TV at least 3 times, and they kept saying they'd come back to help, and then finally, after HOURS, they just said, too bad it's broken. They never actually tried to help fix it.

Business class on that flight was essentially First Class (I think---no first class on that flight to my knowledge) and it was extremely nice. Wow! The best of course was the lie-flat seats (on an overnight flight), but great perks like built-in Bose noise-cancellation headphones, multi-course meals, good wines, big pillows, very attentive service, quiet cabin, and so on. If only I could upgrade that all the time!Their large selection of on-demand video and music programming (in any class) was also very nice for a long flight.

423159769;Lufthansa;1;28.09.16;Sep 16;0;International;Economy;Chicago;Frankfurt;1;2;3;3;3;2;4;This review refers to the returned flight back from USA (the onward flight with Swiss was reasonable, even though it was 9h and a half compared to 7 hours for this one. Even though the aircraft was new, the space at least towards the end of the aircraft was extremely tight. I do fly on a monthly basis with low cost airlines and not the high end ones (easyjet or ryan air that have some better standards) so I am used to being crammed...and this one felt more like a poor low cost airline flight. In addition, I had also two massive males flanking me which made the whole flight duration extremely unpleasant. The stewards also didn't seem very keen to help even though I was quite clear to them I was not happy and there were plenty of empty seats around. regarding leg room, my left foot had only about 10 cm space to move front and back due to some boxes placed under the seat. the other thing I found very strange was the seat belt...one of the ends was extremely short forcing me to stick my hand under the arm rest on a very tight seat anyway...I could barely hold it to close the buckle (again, I am stressing the fact this was the only time this happened for the past 3 years and as I said I am always traveling Economy and most of the time on low cost airlines/crafts)... I suspect it was not 100% ok from safety point of view

There were not enough meat meals so all the last line, except of pre-ordered meals, stuck with vegetarian meals only.

423105505;Lufthansa;4;28.09.16;Sep 16;0;International;Economy;Hong Kong;Frankfurt;3;4;4;4;2;3;2;I flew Lufthansa to Munich from HK for annual vacation for the past two years. I was able to do seat reservation online before flying. However, we were unable to reserve our seat when flying to Frankfurt this September. We tried several times using different computers and could not do it. As such, we arrived early before standard check in time and was told that my husband and I had seats not adjacent to each other. We complained that we were unable to click in to get our desired seats. The staff said it must be due to system error of our computer. We said that we had used iPhone, iPad and two computers to do the work but in vain. We finally got two adjoining seats and flew to Franfurt. Unfortunately, we faced the same scenario the day before our flight back to HK. So we had to go to airport as early as we could. Unlike HK , We , as everyone else, had to check in and got our boarding pass using the machine. As a result, we were assigned two seats which were not very desirable. In the end, I had restrained myself in drinking less water as I didn't want to disturb the aisle seat passenger next to me, The whole flight back was very uncomfortable to me.

Considering the flight was about 8 hours long and there were people going ahead on connecting flights another meal was necessary. There was some turbulence as announced by the captain and he felt it would be unsafe to serve a meal. I am sure serving anything hot would be a problem but they should have circulated some dry snacks or beverages later on when the turbulence stopped. The passenger sitting next to me said she is glad she has a bag of chips with her as she has to board a connecting flight immediately.I think overall the service is good on Lufthansa but this was quite unexpected and could have been handled better at least for those continuing ahead.

If an airline is going to offer PE then the standard needs to be consistent. NZ to Vancouver was excellent, Frankfurt to Tokyo was very good service wise but no priority boarding. Keen to see the last leg - Tokyo to NZ.

Once the gate was open, the use of the self check-in scanners to proceed to the ramp was very convenient and sped the process up immensely. There was no in-flight entertainment system, but with the flight being so short, it wasn't an issue. Once airborne, the attandants sprung into action with the beverage cart, serving everyone in under 20 minutes. They kind of had to move that fast as the flight time was not that much longer. The attendants were cheerful and personable. All in all a good flight.

I did not like one of the meal served though but I'm sure it was because I was not used to it. I also could not get why only one 23kg baggage was allowed. Besides those, it was worth it, no other complains
422996469;Lufthansa;5;27.09.16;Aug 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Singapore;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;Checked in for our economy flight on 8 August and premium economy was available for $350 Singapore dollars each, we took it and are glad we did. Staff were brilliant, good food, a very comfortable flight. When flying long distance next we will certainly look at flying Lufthansa again, hopefully Lufthansa Premium Economy, well worth the extra dollars. Have already recommended Lufthansa to others. We also purchased another upgrade when we flew from Munich to San Francisco, again well worth the spend.
422995738;Lufthansa;1;27.09.16;Aug 16;1;International;Economy;Singapore;Frankfurt;3;3;3;3;3;3;2;Flew with Lufthansa based on the recommendation of friends, and the trusting of a good German brand. Initial impression was less-than-ideal, as we arrived in Singapore from our Qantas flight, to find a man at the Lufthansa desk barking to anyone listening that the flight had been delayed by 10 hours and we were to make our own way to an address scribbled on a piece of paper (presumably a hotel?). Were told our bags, baby seat and pram would be checked right through to Rome, our final destination.BIG mistake.Returned to the airport 8 hours later and kindly asked if we could maybe have a spare seat next to us, as our kids are 2 & 4, and VERY active. We had benefited from an extra seat from SYD-SGP and hoped we could have it again. Despite there being several spare seats near us, the flight attendants refused (kindly, but still refused), to move the man next to us, even though it would have made it easier for everyone.12 long hours later, we arrived in Frankfurt, to find when we boarded our final connecting flight, that our bags, baby seat and pram were all missing.We were on a NINE day trip to Italy for a wedding, our bags were missing for three days, our car seat showed up when we LEFT ITALY to come home to Australia (useless!) and 34 DAYS later, we still haven't had our pram returned, despite dozens of emails and calls trying to find it.If I could be more explicit on here I would, in the hope that Lufthansa reads it, but I will restrain myself.Clearly a month on, it is still causing us stress as our $800 pram is somewhere between Europe and Australia.Awaiting your call, Lufthansa!!!!!!!

These airport lounges are mostly communally designed offereing little chance of a quiet time between flights but most annoying is the absence of quality, cooked foods. Lufthansa must think that this is okay too? An offer of scrambled eggs and no other hot dish was the choice in Frankfurt. I would do two things. Avoid airlines that use Aspire Lounges and avoid Lufthansa. Imhave already stated in a previous review that Lufthansa offered extremely limited legroom from Franfurt to London, less than most economy class seats! Aspire lounges appear to have litle concern for passenger comforts while projecting a corporate image. High heels and fancy uniforms to swan around and retrieve soiled dishes? But no hot food other than tomato soup?Try them ans see if I am overstating this. Last time in Amsterdam, we used KLM lounge...fantastic.
422410534;Lufthansa;5;26.09.16;Aug 16;1;International;Economy;Houston;Frankfurt;4;5;5;5;4;5;5;I was on my way home from Houston Texas, to Glasgow Scotland and had booked using air miles and Lufthansa was part of the cheapest option to get back to Scotland without going through London Heathrow.  Usually I use United and fly from Houston, to Newark and then Newark to Glasgow so I was looking forward to a change in route and scenery. Check in was brilliant and since I was flying with my partner and I am terrified of heights, the woman at the check in counter in Houston was able to switch our seats around so we could be seated together and in the middle of the A380 as to lessen my motion sickness. Dinner was way better than expected as well. As we were sitting in economy we were expecting the usual airline inedible mush. We were surprised and delighted when it was BBQ chicken with cornbread and green beans and we had actual cutlery to eat with! AND we didn't have to pay for our drinks with dinner or the Bailey's after dessert flight! What a bonus!All staff were courteous and had impeccable manners and were also supportive of me practicing my German when asking for things. After we landed in Frankfurt and ran about two miles to our next gate, we boarded the Lufthansa flight to Dublin. Same courteousness and politeness with all the staff who even gave us a little extra time to get situated with our bad knees and offered us pillows if that would help cushion them. All in all, if I could fly Lufthansa for all my flights, I definitely would

421839160;Lufthansa;4;24.09.16;Jul 16;2;Europe;Economy;Amsterdam;Frankfurt;4;4;4;3;3;3;2;To my experience Lufthansa is a professional and reliable airline. The staff is friendly and the flight was on time. On line check in and seat selection is available. For checking in the bags and suitcases there was a huge line at schiphol airport, probably because of high season. Luckily I have a schiphol privium plus membership which allows you a fast business class check in.
421296062;Lufthansa;3;22.09.16;Aug 16;1;International;Economy;Houston;Frankfurt;3;3;4;3;2;3;3;I was traveling from New Orleans to South Africa, and booked travel on Star Alliance partners from New Orleans to Houston, Houston to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to South Africa. The Houston to Frankfurt leg was operated by Lufthansa. The sector I was flying, from Houston to Frankfurt, is operated by an Airbus A380. In addition to economy, Lufthansa also offers Premium Economy on certain sectors and includes access priority boarding, bigger seats, improved meals served on china, bigger PTV screens, and an amenity kit. The one-way price to upgrade from Houston to Frankfurt was about $250 at the airport, and the price was higher on-board from Frankfurt to Houston.As I was combining Star Alliance partners, I had booked my trip through a travel website. I was able to manage my booking on the Lufthansa website, which was easy to use and navigate. On the website I was able to select a special meal, see the upcoming IFE, as well as preselect a seat. Lufthansa does charge to preselect a seat, about $30USD for each sector ‰ÛÒ Qantas and Singapore charge around $50 while South African charges $17 per sector (they have longer sectors though). This charge is to preselect any seat, exit row seats are an extra costs. I had no preselected my seat on the outbound, and was stuck in a middle seat for almost 9 hours so for the return I paid the extra fee to secure an aisle seat. This was the only additional fee that was incurred, as for flights to and from the U.S. Lufthansa allows for a free carryon plus one free checked bag up to 23kg.Since I was connecting to my flight, I did not experience the Lufthansa check-in process. When I had arrived at the gate for my 3:55pm flight, the airplane was already at the gate. The attendants came about an hour prior to departure, and soon afterwards boarding started. Boarding was supposed to be by seat number, but it was extremely chaotic and nobody could understand the boarding system. Lufthansa has different layouts for their A380, and this layout had business class, premium class, and then two sections of economy class on the lower deck
420985043;Lufthansa;4;21.09.16;Sep 16;0;Europe;Economy;Birmingham;Frankfurt;3;4;4;3;;4;2;Had some minor problems at check in. I uttered the word 'Kundendienst' which means customer service. Young lady at check in desk hadnt a clue what I was talking about. Turned out that she didnt work for Lufthansa, but more important, didnt speak German! This is absurd.

We traveled with 2 small children (ages 2 & 4), and each way the flight attendants were super attentive, got us extra waters and juices, made sure the kids were comfortable, and even brought them toys and adorable socks for their flights. I will go out of my way to fly with them again.

It's not even close. And then they charge you full business class fares. Air Canada's so called discount arm - ""Rouge"" - does the same thing. Real airlines charging premium prices should provide a premium experience. We arrived in Frankfurt to find that there was no gate so they put us at the terminal area that services international flights. Then we took buses back to where we were supposed to be so that we could then hike back over to where we landed. Yikes! What a mess. I will say the cabin crew was terrific."

The cleanest plane I have ever been on, and, aside from one rather curt flight attendant, the best service I have ever had. Now on to the ridiculous: When the seat in front of you is reclined, there is ABSOLUTELY NO LIVING SPACE!!! I had the misfortune on the outbound flight to have the man in front of my fully reclined during the entire 11 hour trip, and the very tall lady behind me with her knees against my back and her feet sticking so far under my seat we played footsies all the way to Germany. If the person in front of you is reclined, you have no choice but to recline yourself, but in my case I could not. On the flight coming home, I was able to recline, and that made the time in the chair more bearable. HOWEVER, if you need to exit the seat to use the restroom (which you most likely will need to at some point in 11 hours) you need to actually STAND ON SEAT TO GET OUT!!!!!! I am 50 so I was able to do this. My mother would not be physically be able to. There simply is NO ROOM BETWEEN RECLINED SEAT AND STATIONARY ARMREST ON AISLE SEAT TO EXIT SEAT, THUS ONE IS FORCED TO GET INTO A CROUCHED POSITION AND STAND ON SEAT AND STEP OVER STATIONARY ARMREST!!! AT LEAST MAKE THE ARMRESTS MOVABLE!!! I love traveling and try to go as often as I can. This is simply unacceptable. If this is the industry standard nowadays, I guess I will no longer travel unless I can afford upgraded seating, which is really not an upgrade at all. Simply bearable. I am 50 years old, 5'6 and 155 pounds. My husband is 54, 5'9 and 165 pounds. Awful and tortuous experience.

So it was good to know that I would reach my destination in time. However, in the name of snack, all we were provided was a stick of candy!! Certainly this is not snack in true sense, though one can keep arguing endlessly on the technicality of it.Did not like this approach of the and for sure, the airline needs to improve. Remember this is not a low cost airline. It is full service airline for which the passengers pay about double the amount than a budget airline.

There was no information in the inflight magazine about it which could have helped.

Lufthansa has put coach seats in their Business Class Cabin. Three seats across , same as coach, Same size seats as coach same amount of leg room,no way to tilt back and relax,Thev only difference being they have blocked the middle seat. Please check the seating before booking with this airline. When I pay extra, and I mean a lot extra I expect to be seated in a comfortable seat. I will never fly with them again. When I complained Lufthansa sent my husband and myself selt two fifty uro vouchers they can be used only be used in duty free.

415135900;Lufthansa;5;05.09.16;Jul 16;2;International;Economy;Orlando;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;I recently booked a round-trip flight from Orlando to Frankfurt on United Airlines. Ultimately the overseas portions were operated by Lufthansa. I can not say enough about how great the outbound and return flights were. I have traveled to Europe several times but never on Lufthansa. These were possibly the best flights I've ever had. The flight attendants I encountered were great. They were available continually throughout the flight. They worked hard going up and down the aisles checking on the passengers. They offered refreshments and meals at various times. They were always checking to see if anyone had any trash or needed anything. Furthermore, the plane was clean, there was plenty of seating space and legroom even though I did not pay extra for it, and the entertainment package was great. Also, the flights were on time. I do not have a single negative comment. I will definitely try to fly with Lufthansa when I can.

There was a headset, blanket and pillow. A personal TV screen large enough to enjoy their vast selection of free films. The food was really good and was surprised. The staff was cordial and helpful with any request. The new A 380 was so quiet and comfortable, much nicer that a 747. Really had a good time.

I will never forget the experience. Not only are the seats absolutely gorgeous with digital control to adjust it precisely as you want but also service is magnificent. They really do pamper you and make you feel at home. Brilliant airline! The only bad thing is their hub. Frankfurt airport is an unfriendly place. Apart from that, flying with them is worth every penny.

Both flights were completely full. We were boarded quickly and efficiently with a warm welcome by the staff. Throughout the flight our service was excellent and the food good. Even with a few difficult passengers the staff remained gracious. We were very pleased to have chosen premium economy for such a long flight for the more comfortable seat and leg room. The entertainment screens are also larger for,those who like to use them.

Yes, we were backtracking, but at the time I booked this, it was the best option. Anyway, the first flight was delayed, so we missed the connecting flight in Frankfurt. In Frankfurt, we were booked onto a later flight to Heathrow, then on a British Air flight to Philadelphia. Fine, it delayed us by a few hours, no big deal. Well, except that the Lufthansa flight to Heathrow was late arriving and we missed the British Air connection. We had to spend the night at a hotel near Heathrow and fly out the next morning. By then, we were no longer amused, but Lufthansa picked up the tab for everything and the airport personnel in both places were great - very helpful, very apologetic. I'm not actually sure why I am writing this review because I don't really have a complaint. I know these things happen and the flights themselves were fine. I am not sure what Lufthansa's percentage of delayed flights is, but I'd kind of like to know if other passengers have had similar experiences with this carrier.

So, I was slightly disappointed.The lunch after departure was acceptable, nothing more. As I saw some months ago Lufthansa making advertisements based on good food, I was expecting more (although the French wine was very good for me) ) but I found it was as before, or even slightly worse. There were a cheese plate and a desert, and when I took the cheese plate, they did not offer me a desert. I could have claimed, but they should have proposed and it was up to me to decline, if I did not want to. I think that' s called ""service"" The dinner before arrival was also acceptable, but nothing special.I was seated in the front area of business class. When I reserved my seat, I did not know that Row 1 is for passengers with a baby (A bassinet could be installed.). So, from time to time I heard a crying baby, which was not agreeable for me, who wanted to spend a quiet time. (This is not Lufthansa'a fault, though)So, don't reserve a seat in the front area, if you want to travel quietly. Normally a (chief) cabin attendant normally greets Gold members personally on board. This time there was no personalized welcome greetings from them. Of course Being greeted personally does not give any special advantages, but a personal touch is always better than nothing.Normally, they ask Gold members the choice of meals in priority, but this time I do not think they did this time.As a whole, the service quality has degraded a little as compared to previous times."

Finally boarded and then found that ""Business class"" was just the first 6 rows in an economy class plane with 6 seats (3 either side of aisle) making totalm of 36 seats of which only half had passengers. Was seated in row 6 with 3 children directly in row behind me (no division) and was kicked in back all the way to Frankfurt. A complete joke for Business Class."

409491155;Lufthansa;3;23.08.16;Aug 16;0;Europe;Business Class;Budapest;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;I have travelled from Budapest to Frankfurt in Business Class. I think it is a waste of money to choose Business Class in an European Route. The seats are the same as in Economy. The only difference is the middle seat is free. The only reason why i there travelled is i have travelled further intercontinental and you could not mix the cabin classes. Otherwise i would not chose it again.

Lufthansa had a class structure, hence first and business class had priority. At 11 pm the ticket system had only moved to 352 in 4 hours. We were told to continue to wait if we wanted our flight to Beijing confirm. At 3-15am we were called because the airport was closing and told we may not get a flight also we need to return to the airport between 8 and 10am. They offered us a hotel which was an hour away and we're told by a very rude member of staff, that we were lucky. I complained that they could have sent us to a hotel hours before or at least to get a meal. They only gave us water, biscuits and a sandwich in the 9 hours. Then to be told that we shouldn't complain about the poor service. We missed a day of our holiday. Shame on you Lufthansa.

Food was nothing special, it never is, but it was even less special (asked for non-lactose). Legroom is smaller every year it seems, specially with the introduction of the Economy plus class (we could upgrade to it for 600 euros... 600 ?!)

There was then a problem when one of the machines loading baggage failed and had to be replaced, all of which meant that the plane arrived half an hour late in Frankfurt. I still had time to make my train connection, but almost had to run quite a long distance through the airport to do it. However, when I was on the plane I was satisfied with the flight and the service. The in-flight food was a reasonably tasty sandwich. The staff were pleasant and the seats were comfortable.

Actually I was taking a trip around the world and went from South Africa to Istambul, from there to Germany and so on. The prices they have are no longer so competitive, the airplanes can be very old and even the crew sometimes lacks a good expertise in speaking English, which I personally criticize on international flights. My seat was NOT respected and from Gerrmany I flew all way to Mexico City in the worst seat ever and in Mexico I made a formal complaint to the company and listed quite a few problems. They bothered to respond just saying the fee I was paying was low!Besides that, I gave to mother a ticket using my miles and ALL the information given to me by their central was wrong! My mother would then be flying South African Airways and their luggage allowance is usually 2PC for intercontinental flights but LH said it was a LH ticket on a SA plane and the alloance would be 1PC. BUT IW WAS WRONG!

Food was also good.Return flight was a bit of a mess. I've had this twice now in Frankfurt. The flight was fully booked. The check in was terrible, if you have an extra bag be prepared to run around the airport to check it and pay the fee (apparently there is only one credit card machine for the whole airline). Boarding was a total mess, no groups or rows, people were running others over to get on the plane (first time I've seen it done this way and hopefully the last). Once on the plane everything was great and the crew was awesome.They charge $45/way for online seat reservations.

Especially from Lufthansa! As one of the world's premier airlines, I have a level of expectation and that was not met. I sat in seat 24D. Absolutely no IFE and nothing they could do for me. What they should have done was advise me before the airplane took off. So while everyone else enjoyed their meals while watching a movie, I got to sit there and be angry.Look I know how things work, airplane breaks they know it. The KNEW it was broken and the purser even confirmed it and could offer nothing but an apology and to advise me to contact customer service.

It is our airline of choice to take us to a place where nothing is sure. Including your reserved and paid for air plane tickets. (For example on Turkish airlines you can go to the airport in Adana with ticket in hand, and be told that there is no room for you because your seat was given to some local officials and their families, and that you need to wait for an empty seat on another flight which can take 3-4 days) so Lufthansa is great as it brings European standard whereever they go and no amount of clout, money or influence will affect a how they operate: efficiently!The staff is a bit uptight, but friendly and helpful, but they can be occasionally a bit obsessive about carry on size and weight. The weight limit is extremely small, 8kg-16lb. Your carry on weighs half of your limit. Sigh. But if your bag looks smallish (RIMOVA or Samsonite is good) then they leave you alone. Lufthansa partners with Austrian which is plain down militaristic about carry on weight and commonly weight all carry on before boarding seating launch. But once you stuff your over the limit weight into your messenger bag or purse and get through the weight station, you can re-stuff it to your carry on. If you are unlucky you will have to get your carry on checked and pay for second bag. I say this as a warning because if Lufthansa has canceled your flight you will get rescheduled and it could be a flight with Austrian.Planes are newer with plenty of leg room and possible internet on board service for $14 (I think it was) for the entire 8h flight. Food is actually descent, for airline food, not great, just eatable. Though I recommend that you get your self a sandwich for the flight at some bistro. Flight attendants are friendly and helpful.Frankfurt airport is nice with plenty of food choices, and shops to browse till your next flight. Transferring to your next flight is quick and easy. Again highly recommend that you check prices directly from Lufthansa, most of the time I get the same price as on search airline engines and better connection choices. Several times I actually got cheaper ticket buying directly from them.

I fly many times Economy on short haul like this flight. The connections (in Munich and Frankfurt) usually work efficiently. The business lounges are a bit simple but improved over the past years. Cabin staff is very professional in the best possible sense of the word. Prices are not low but still okay.

Purser and air hostesses smart and courteous, pilot kept passengers well informed and was very apologetic for landing 2 minutes late. Plane was clean and boarding civilised. In flight service was good although the coffee could have been stronger and it would be nice to have the option of ordinary milk instead of cream. As a bonus, my flight pulled in at a gate today instead of having to get a bus as frequently happens at FRA- this is easily the worst major airport in Europe for this reason and should be avoided at all costs when you need to connect.

It was only a short flight, but everything from check in, ground staff, the flight itself and punctuality were perfect. I am a Qantas FF and i was pleasantly surprised to see a carrier that is actually free of the drama and hidden surprises of Qantas.

Eventually got away over 1 hour late - because - so they eventually said- the air con was faulty - why could they not tell the plane load of hot frustrated travelers that at the time rather than leave us sitting there while they chatted to each other - NOT an example of German efficency at all.

Excellent service and food, the plane landing early even, friendly, plenty of space... However the 747 was still equipped with the old generation of business class seats that cannot be moved into a fully horizontal position. This is the only minor criticism.

Original, pre-selected seating was changed, but it worked out with some swaps anyway. Pillows and blankets were provided directly for the kids which was good as they just wanted to sleep. Unfortunately there was a baby crying non-stop, but what can you do, they also have the right to fly business, right? :)Food wasn't impressive, some cold stuff, which I can't even remember what it was, see picture. To compensate we had plenty of good drinks."

I have no major issue with anything in perticular, they are maintaining high standard. My only remark was about food, it come cold. LH has strong hub in India so menu was also prepared favouring Indian dishes. In general, using LH you can not miss.

Food was (and I am being charitable) okay. For the YYZ/FRA leg I had seat 1K. (14A FRA/YYZ). The advantage of 1K is that if you need to get out of your seat there is room to walk around the passenger in the seat next to you. I really hate the configuration as window seats do not have direct aisle access. The other thing that I did not like was that the seats felt very narrow even though it was 20 inches. In the lay flat position it felt a little claustrophobic.

I was travelling with my baby by myself and had the back pain, At the airport they didnt gave me the wheelchair because i have the baby. Now they want me to carry my baby and cabin luggage without any help. One guy from airlines asked me to pay money to help out with my luggage till boarding gate. after that in flight, I asked them to sterilize the baby bottles, they told me they dont do it. I have made several request for help but they cancel my request without even showing up. I asked them to keep an eye on my baby when i want to use the washroom, they declined and told me to manage by yourself. i wont travel with this airlines anymore.

The flight, plane and crew were all of the standard that one would expect from a major European airline, but the problems began as we were approaching the destination. For some reason, there was a delay in landing at Frankfurt, and we were told that there would be staff to direct and assist for those, like us, who were travelling to further destinations. We eventually landed, and true to the statement, there was someone there in a uniform telling folks where to go. Unfortunately, because our onward flight was not within the next hour, she did not have the relevant information and told us to go to the customer service desk. This we did, and werte given the flight departure gate and pointed in the direction to go to that gate. Unwittingly, we set off, following the signs interminably, came to a train station where we had to take a train to a more distant part of the airport, and then continued interminably, eventually arriving at the allotted departure gate more than an hour after we set off from where we had landed, and with very little time to spare. Frankfurt airport was a complete nightmare and I will do everything possible to avoid using it again.

On this flight to Frankfurt I was lucky enough to be upgraded from Premium Economy to Business Class on one of their 747-800 aircraft.There are two sets of Business Class seats on this plane. One behind the first class cabin on the main floor and 22 seats in the upper deck. They are configured in a 2-2 configuration. I was in an aisle seat and my co-worker was at the window.As you can imagine they are spacious seats with a very large touchscreen entertainment monitor. They are also lie flat seats that can accommodate a 6ft plus person. The only downside is the window person must jump over the aisle person if they are sleeping in a lie flat position.The service and food options were excellent and the flight was very comfortable.

I take my seat and when able to do so, I try to put my seat back and get another passenger that tells me that he's sorry but he doesn't fit and I can't put the seat back. i kindly tell him that I paid for the seat and that he should go tell the crew his problem. So a bit mad he did that and they gave him a seat where he fit. He was quite tall. I think airlines should see this before customers have a bad time discussing the subject. In every other sense the service was real good, water is passed frequently. Good choice of movies, and other programs. Clean bathrooms.

The much longer lines on the 2 Economy Class counters moved much faster. The Business Class passengers had to wait. As 3 persons were sitting just around I went up to them asking, if they could open another counter for Business Class passengers as well and was told, it was not possible and it the waiting time was because the Business Class was fully booked (in the end Business Class was 3/4 empty when we came on board. The lounge in Marrakesh is a disaster. When we came on board and the service began, we were basically ignored by the crew as it happened to be that the executive board member for human resources was sitting in the back of the business class cabin and therefor he had highest priority to the crew and not any paying passenger. I made a complaint after this flight to Lufthansa, but never heard back from them. This is their ""Nonstop-You"" customer service!"

Would pick Lufthansa 90% of the time over any other airline. Always punctual, good service and properly maintained aircraft. Hardly ever delayed. Give it a try, you likely will become a regular!
403414833;Lufthansa;5;09.08.16;May 16;3;International;Business Class;Rio de Janeiro;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;"This was the fourth or fifth time in the new Business Class configuration, and again my wife and I were happy that we were traveling together, and did not sit with a stranger: the fact that the two seats are slightly turned to each other still makes us uneasy thinking about sharing that space with a stranger. Apart from that, service in Business Class has improved. In March, we bitterly complained about the slowness of the ""Signature Service"", when the wrong food arrived so late that I was going to sleep anyway. This time, the stewards and stewardesses were efficient and friendly. Food is good. Wines are ok - Lufthansa used to have much better wines several years ago, but that's the way it goes, cost savings hit. Sleeping quality is good. The entertainment system is fine, if you don't fly often. Since the previous flight in March, the program seemed not to have changed."

A choice of cheese or salmon sandwich was provided along with tea, coffee, alcohol, soft drink or water.The only surprise was that we had to be taken to the terminal by bus after disembarking at Frankfurt.
403195563;Lufthansa;3;09.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Singapore;Frankfurt;3;3;4;3;4;4;3;We chose this airline as part of a package for our European trip. The premium economy seats offer a better experience than economy. More legroom and more space generally. That said the seats don't recline very much so don't count on getting a comfortable sleep. The flight departed late at night so we were able to doze off quite soon after take off. The premium economy seats are wedged between the economy and business class and with curtains at both ends it wasn't entirely clear which facilities were meant for us. The crew were very formal and somewhat instructive in their dealings with passengers, which was a bit odd. The food reminded me of airline food from the 1980's. The best feature on the plane was the tail mounted camera, which gave you an incredible view of the plane as it flew. The entertainment options were also good.Overall ok for the price paid.
403074573;Lufthansa;3;08.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Singapore;Frankfurt;4;3;3;3;3;4;3;Not much of a change from economy, the seats had a little more room but the service seemed no better than being in the back. Food came on plastic trays with plastic cutlery and was nothing memorable. This class shared the economy toilets which meant queues, we did Singapore-Frankfurt on an A380 and Munich-Beijing on a 777 with Lufthansa both flights Premium Economy. Because they still have First Class Premium Economy is just Economy with bigger seats. Now we know why it was a good deal financially but nothing about this would lead us to specify Lufthansa again
403050422;Lufthansa;5;08.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Business Class;Delhi;Frankfurt;5;4;5;5;5;5;5;Was excited to fly the A380 for the first time. It is a huge plane and was surprised by the smooth and short take off. The business class configuration was 2-2-2 and privacy is not a concern. If you fly solo, you are very close to your neighbours. If you are in a window seat you will have to step over your neighbour by the aisle if they are sleeping lying flat. The service and food is very good even though one flight attendant made me feel a bit uncomfortable as I'm a minority and didn't speak German. The flight was very pleasant though.The Lufthansa lounge was Ok in Delhi.

Unfortunately, this does tend to make basic economy even more basic, especially with regards to the lack of legroom.I have used Lufthansa's premium economy service several times now and it is by far the best I have experienced. You experience a better menu, increased attention from cabin crew and, importantly, a wider seat and much more legroom. On this particular flight, I was lucky enough to also be beside an emergency exit and the legroom was huge. You also receive a small kitbag with socks, eye mask, etc.- not as good as business class but a nice touch.The only disappointing feature was in-flight entertainment

On-line check in is not always very efficient. However check-in at Frankfurt is excellent - much better than the organised chaos of Manchester.

The cabin is designed with space and comfort in mind, the seats have a whopping 83 inches in pitch, we could not even reach the ottoman in front of us and had to have it moved forward with a touch of a button. Upon boarding you are greeted by your two FA's and the purser, as there are only 8 seats and on this flight only 6 of us it felt like an intimate cabin. You are provided a locker for your items and to hang your clothes so you can change into a pair of Van Laack pajamas. Once settle in you are offered champagne and after take off the parade of food begins: starting with an amuse bouche, followed by caviar service, and then an appetizer trolley. Entrees and desserts are ample and delicious. The one amazing thing about this plane is that this cabin was designed for quiet, there is additional sound proofing in the floors and walls so its truly quiet and the curtains are heavily padded so there is no disruption from the galley. In addition there are two bathroom for 8 people so you are never waiting in line. The most incredible part of the journey came at the end as our flight departed Chicago late and we only had 40 minutes to make our connection to Paris. The purser advised us a passenger representative would help us make our connection. When we left the plane the representative greeted us on the jetway and we took and elevator down to a private Mercedes Benz, he whisked us away to diplomatic passport control (No Lines!) and then to our Paris bound gate where he took us up from the tarmac in an elevator to the gate and introduced us to the gate attendants to make sure we were take care of. That whole process took 20 minutes. We would never make our flight otherwise. Again an amazing service experience!

I was lucky to be travelling in Business class. The middle seat in the rows of three is left free so you get plenty of 'elbow room'. The Captain introduced himself and said that due to westerly tailwinds our flight would only be 35 minutes. Knowing you get a meal and drink service I was curious to see how they managed. What they did was offer no service in economy as they would never have had the time. So the only served the people in Business. Wow... they were very quick, still remained friendly and of course were super efficient. The food was a cold selection of salads with a Thai small main skewer of chicken. The roll was even warm. Drinks were offered immediately after the food and with at least 10 rows in Business it was quite a feat to see and experience.

Add to that late departure both directions and hard work to get wheelchair assistance from Frankfurt, means they could do a lot better.

As Business Class was overbooked I received an upgrade to First. The service was perfect as both flight attendants were very attentive and friendly. As appetizer I had the caviar and poached pink salmon followed by the duck confit. Main course was the grilled tenderloin which was nice but no match to Argentinian barbecue of course. Dessert was the eclair with fruits. The drinks (Taittinger and French Red Wine) worked fine with the above mentioned. As always a pleasure to fly with Lufthansa!
402294952;Lufthansa;4;07.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Shanghai;Frankfurt;4;5;5;4;4;3;4;Flew Premium Economy, Shanghai to Frankfurt, well worth the extra cost. Very comfortable flight, lots of leg-room, great service. Would happily book this again. Only downside was our late evening flight was cancelled which meant an overnight stay in Frankfurt but Lufthansa forked out for the hotel without quibbling.
402265772;Lufthansa;4;06.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Toronto;Frankfurt;4;3;5;3;5;2;3;if you want to know what is was like to fly economy class in 1986, book a seat in Lufthansa's Premium Economy section. For an additional $340 you can experience a proper sized seat, stainless steel cutlery and realistic, but not generous bar service. Expect your tray table to be a little smaller than the 1986 version and don't even think about a linen napkin! You will experience a cornucopia of in flight entertainment options well beyond the take-it-or-leave-it single movie showing of 30 years ago, but of course this is available to the entire aircraft, so nothing special for your additional $340. I would have enjoyed pre-boarding and a better meal, which was below even 1986 economy class standards. But I did arrive without the sore back, which is pretty much guaranteed if flying trans-atlantic cattle car class these days. Worth the extra $340 to experience economy class c.1986? I think $5 worth of Robaxacet might be the better investment.

I was pleasantly surprised as it easily outclassed most other airlines I frequently fly (United, AA, Southwest). Stewardesses were very friendly and attentive. The seats seemed sightly wider than other airlines as well. The food was about average from what you would expect from a airline for a transatlantic flight, but thoroughly enjoyed the free wine!
402163550;Lufthansa;5;06.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;Economy;Buenos Aires;Frankfurt;4;5;5;5;5;4;4;It was a long overnight flight. Everything impecably clean, the seats and space much like other airlines. However, I found the details of a hot, damp cloth to freshen up with before meals, the offer of an after dinner Baileys and even the metal cutlery instead of the plastic that invariably breaks, very important. During the night there was always a member of the crew offering glasses of water or even a biscuit to those who were awake. I felt very well cared for.

Airline strike, after it was called off 2. Rough weather at Frankfurt ( weirdly enough all other Lufthansa planes were departing same airport without issue 3. Lastly the true reason being not having enough occupancy!Being left stranded is the least of it. Not being given any information is another! Been left in queue for 5 hrs to be given a room for the overnight stay. Been asked to be back at the airport at 10 for a flight at 1500, queued for 9 hrs before the counter opened with them not having any information from Lufthansa!Finally been booked on next day flight ! 14 hrs queue time with zero information, no food or compensation! This is a common occurrence for Lufthansa on this destination, avoid!!!!

401747755;Lufthansa;5;05.08.16;May 16;3;International;Economy;San Francisco;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;When United Airlines flight out of Palm Springs to San Francisco was delayed, we missed our connection to Frankfurt, Germany. We had paid United for Economy Plus seats for the long haul. United found us seats on a Lufthansa flight and we couldn't have been happier. We got a refund for the Economy Plus from United as Lufthansa didn't have that available. But...the Lufthansa coach seats are larger and the seats farther apart for an 11 hour flight. Economy Plus for a coach price! We had excellent service: free meals (3) free drinks, unlimited, and free choice of many films on the flight. This airline really has it together. If you thought this review was helpful, let Trip Adviser know.

She took extra care of my daughter. I like how Lufthansa limits the number of announcements. One thing they could stress is that people keep the window shades closed during the day as a courtesy to passengers who want to rest.Will fly them again.
401723092;Lufthansa;5;05.08.16;Apr 16;4;International;Premium Economy;Panama City;Frankfurt;5;3;4;4;5;5;4;"Lufthansa offers this ""in between"" Class option. Their Premium Economy is a real separate class with wider seat with more space than in Economy compared to airlines like American or Finnair, which have standard Economy seat with few centimetres more seat pitch. So seat is wider, offers more pitch and recline with bigger TV screen. IFE has large variety of movies and TV series to choose from. On the way and back you can't manage to watch all movies, even with fast forward.Otherwise the service is closer to Economy. Food is served on china and offers options. Beverages are for free (not guaranteed nowadays on all airlines). Nice advantage of the Premium Economy is that you deboard after Business Class, putting you forward at immigration queue.Summary: Premium Economy is good option, if your company doesn't pay Business or good way of making holiday travel a pleasure."
401675496;Lufthansa;3;05.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Economy;Athens;Frankfurt;3;4;4;2;2;3;4;"Economy seats are somehow thinner than usual and the food is average. In my last flight (2.5 hours) there was only one type of bread available. So far so good, i can understand this, short flight, economy class etc. But that only type was not normal white bread, it was one of those ""healthy"" ones full of seeds on them, like we all need to get to help our bowel start working.Is a normal bread too much to ask for?? :-)Moreover, their frequent passengers program is one of the worse i have seen, in terms of earning miles, really hard to upgrade.Yes, Lufthansa is a reliable company for sure but somehow it seems to me that if you fly economy with them you don't get too much, generally speaking and always comparing with the economy class of other European airlines.Ah, just remembered one more, if you buy the Light fare and you are a gold star alliance member, they don't give you the right to bring along a check-in bag for free (as they do in Aegean for example)."
401665880;Lufthansa;2;05.08.16;Nov 15;9;International;Business Class;Amman;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;Departing at 02:35 and having worked all day one would look forward to a business class with a comfortable seat and some recline to be able to sleep. Unfortunately it seems that LH use the intra-European aircraft for this service so no recline, no real legroom and the inability to sleep. Arriving in FRA and having to connect the day which one may have thought gained to be able to work in the office is wasted due to tiredness and a bad back so you end up going home to sleep. Please do not call it Business Class !!
401646287;Lufthansa;3;05.08.16;Aug 16;0;Europe;Economy;Manchester;Frankfurt;4;1;4;3;2;3;3;Great start to our holiday.....not! Having been delayed by passengers who were still shopping, the captain decided to wait for them rather than offloading them. As a result, we missed our connecting flight to Saltzburg. There were also passengers travelling to Nice on the flight, their flight to Nice was 15mins earlier departing than ours. they got taken off the plane on landing and taken directly to their plane. This did not happen for us. By the time that we had gone through the usual nonsense, we had missed our plane. Thanks Lufthansa! They offered us a flight to Salzburg at 9.30pm that night (we had arrived at 12.15 in Frankfurt). Not prepared to listen to a ranting Englishman with 3 children under 9, we finally were offered a flight at 3.00 to Munich which we took (only because we couldn't stand the hassle of a 9 hour wait at Frankfurt). We then got a taxi from Munich to our hotel in Saalbach at a cost of 400 euros. We'll wait and see if they offer any compensation! Not impressed at all.

My neighbour selected from the on board movie list: Zomby land. I hate horror and likely many others +children, youngsters, ladies, etc. These screens are not private so what if accidental view cause physical or mental trouble for someone in the air?

401480843;Lufthansa;2;04.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Economy;Barcelona;Frankfurt;3;4;4;2;3;2;1;The bad rating comes because of our terrible experience from the check-in services at the BCN airport. The staff at the counter was extremely impolite accusing us for not having made a prior online check for the 4 members of our family (which was not possible for technical reasons during our vacation) and making the check-in procedure extremely complicated for him, as he had to rearrange seats. Unacceptable behavior for the staff of a big airline, like Lufthansa. Additional minus point comes from the food on board. We received a small simple sandwich, while we paid a 'fortune' for the flight. Even at AirBerlin the food was better! :-)

I use noise cancelling ear buds and LH makes it difficult to use anything but there headsets. with help of crew and a flashlight we managed. With my earbuds a sleep on hard seats was possible.

This was great for me as I have an old knee injury and was able to extend my right leg the whole trip. As far as economy trips across the Atlantic go, this was a very good experience with good service and seats/entertainment systems. We connected to Stuttgart on the train which I highly recommend if you are headed that way. To find such connections add ""ZWS"" to the airport code for Stuttgart ""STR"" and it will show the Lufthansa high speed train connections as well."

We handed over 100 Rand and went on our way. I feel we should NEVER have been put in this position and it seems clear to me that staff at the airline should have picked up the potential problem at the booking stage.

I read up on the airlines that flew the route, and Lufthansa seemed the best bet- not to mention I love Germany, and the leg from Boston-Frankfurt was going to be on a brand-new 747-8i. As a plane geek, I was sold. Check-in at Logan was a breeze, and we were airside within 15-20 minutes. The Lufthansa Business Lounge at BOS is small, but comfortable, and has a good selection of snacks and drinks. My friend that was traveling with us and I got bored after a while, so we went and had a glass of wine in the terminal.Soon it was time to board, and I had selected seats on the upper deck of the plane. There is a really cool, unique feeling about walking up a staircase on a plane, and the cabin is fairly small so it's easy to forget that you're actually on a 747. The flight attendants were very friendly and accommodating, and I was flattered that my responses to them in the (basic) German that I know were met with more of a ""good job! If you get bored, we can practice later on in the flight!"" than a disdainful look of my attempt to use the native language. The seats were incredibly comfortable, new, and the whole cabin had a really tasteful design. The food was good, the service was great, and it was a truly enjoyable flight. I'd fly Lufthansa again in a heartbeat."

They are great for a short flight to Europe but definitely not a long haul flight. Food is basic but tasty.

401308127;Lufthansa;4;04.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;Premium Economy;Singapore;Frankfurt;4;4;4;4;3;4;4;My hubby decided to upgrade my seat to premium economy (PY) at the airport since I have never tried One before. Anyhow, I have never flown on LH before and was not expecting too much. The seat was comfortable and I thought well, it's ok. Nothing really to shout about. The moment I boarded I decided to sleep, forgoing my supper from Singapore. When I woke up some hours later, I was famished. Hence, I walked over to the galley to ask for some food. The sterward who was there gave me instant noodles. As he was worried that I would spill the noodles and hurt myself, he gave me a tray filled with appetizer and dessert to take away. Boy, was I surprised! I thought not bad at all the service, much better than expected. After some hours of flying, breakfast was served before arrival. When the same steward who served me the instant noodles asked if I wanted coffee or tea, I asked for hot milk instead. Alas, he told me that they do not serve that. So I said just give me the cold milk then. He came back after a while and I was wondering why he took more than a minute to do so. When he served me the milk, I was again pleasantly surprised that he had warmed up my milk! This is what I called going the extra mile for service. I did not catch the name of the steward but because of him, I must commend that LH has trained their staff well. Keep up the good work, LH!

The flight was a bargain included in a cruise, so I really wasn't expecting much. I just wanted to get there and start having fun. Instead I walked into a torture chamber.I noticed immediately this was the smallest plane I'd ever taken across any ocean, but it was just an observation. I'd been on smaller planes on domestic flights. I assumed Lufthansa knew what it was doing, but I understood why my baggage limitations had been so restricted.Then I found my seat. I'm 5'8"", so it seemed as if I chewed on my knees the whole way, but that's not even what bothered me. Thank goodness I'm thin enough that the size of my seat was not a problem. But again, I knew I'd gotten a bargain.Here's what bugged me. The whole plane shook like it was going to come apart over the ocean. I am not a timid flyer. I usually crawl into a book or watch a movie and ignore the plane. That was absolutely impossible.I usually have trouble getting to sleep on a plane, but I usually able to at least doze a little and relax. On this trip I never got a moments rest. There was no room for me to get comfortable and the rattling of the equipment drove me crazy. Yes, I tried headphones, earplugs, sleep masks and every imaginable position. Even when I couldn't actually hear the rattling, the ride was so bumpy that I felt like I was on a wooden roller coaster. Of course, there were a few times that we had a sudden bump or drop, but that I could have lived with. It was the unrelenting vibration that kept me on alert.As you can imagine, the service was brisk to the point of terseness and the food was mediocre. I get it. I was in economy, but on this flight, with all the rattling, I wonder if the people in first class actually had it much better. Sure they didn't have their knees under their chin, but they had to feel that constant vibration."

However confirmed the return flight to Orlando from Frankfurt on Lufthansa DID , Both placed by Vantage, blaming Vantage for the oversight ! Strange, Vantage booked the reservation for both segments, but made no seat request for the outbound, but did the return, I THINK NOT, Lufthansa did nothing to correct the situation, we spent 9 hours in the middle two of four sitting ! Also, Lufthana told me they had been kicked out of the TSA Global Entry system, what does that infur to you ? Form your own opinion !

I attend at least 1 movie a week. On the trip back I watch 4 movies that I had not seen before. We always enjoy the flights. The only problem is Frankfurt Airport. We were bused from the tarmac to the building where we had to walk all over the airport to get to where we need to go to. That is the airport's problem, not the airline.

On November 9th my outbound flight to Hong Kong was cancelled because of the strikes. I only received an email less than 24h before telling nothing but ""we're sorry but your flight as been cancelled"". Nothing else ! The link to my bookings did not work, I couldn't find any valid information about what to do on your website and I spend hours (and a significant amount of money) calling your booking service in France, Spain, Germany and even UK to find a solution. Your French booking service hang up on me twice while I was begging for a rerouting on another company. I only managed to reach someone competent and polite on the same day who managed to fly me to my destination (with 3 connexions though). Two weeks later, while checking in for my return flight, I asked very politely your ground personnel if by chance they could make up for the inconvenience by making my flight back a little more comfortable. I was not going for business or first class, no... But I thought a little effort would be made or at least that I would get a polite appology for the inconvenience. I think the most suitable description of the answer I got from your Hong Kong ground personnel (Lufthansa personnel) is contemptuous and despising. And here's the seat I got... 94C corridor, the closest seat to the toilets and the noisy flight attendants with absolutely no room for my feet. 14 hours sitting slantwise ! I didn't even think those kind of seats existed ! If your personnel could have given me a seat on the wing, they would have done it ! I don't have any doubt about it ! Obvioulsy, after this absolutely dreadful flight I tried to fill in a complaint form at your customer desk in Frankfurt... but was unable to because another contemptuous and despising Lufthansa employee stopped me before I could even get in the line and told me I had to send an email which would be answered on an undefined extension of time. Needless to say that's the last time I'm flying with Lufthansa...Fun-fact. When my outbound flight to Hong Kong was cancelled by Lufthansa on November 9th because of the strikes, I have been re-routed to my destination with Iberia and British Airlines. When I checked in, the Iberia ground staff in Bilbao apologized in the name of Lufthansa and gave me this economy seat with plenty of room for my legs as a compensation. And I didn't even have to ask for it ! They did the two things Lufthansa, responsible for the inconvenience, didn't even bother to do : apology and make me feel a little better. Please learn you contemptuous and despising Lufthansa people ! I obviously sent an email to Lufthansa complaining for the situation. I managed to have the money spent on the phone with their customer service back (50‰âÂ!!!) but absolutely NO goodwill gesture. This is the LAST TIME I fly with them..."

The airline changed the type of plane 2 days ago but didnt bother to update our reserved paid for seats. We were a family of 14 who paid to sit together. We were given seats with 6 year old not sitting with mother, a daughter in law with fractured ankle in the middle of large row, a 6'6"" son in the middle of a row and myself with a disability not given another thought and separated from my husband and also the rest of the family.Disgusting. The seats we originally chose were carefully thought of to accomodate our various issues.No email from Lufthansa to notify change of plane and to tell us of updated ridiculous choice of seats and as far as the staff was concerned we could either sit down or get off the plane. Arrogance. A definate update on dealing with people a must.Other points, the food wasnt good. We had children, and vegetarians and regular meals. The childrens wasnt bad but the rest not great. All in all a very disappointing experience"

401255336;Lufthansa;5;04.08.16;Apr 16;4;International;Premium Economy;Philadelphia;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;We flew to Frankfurt and then traveled to Prague for three nights prior to embarking on a Viking cruise from Passau Germany down the Danube. Our flight was superb and the service we received was spectacular. We were very satisfied with the nice snacks and dinner too. We haven't travelled the world and most of our flying has been within the U.S.- so, we were kind of used to the old bag of peanuts or trail mix and a soda. The snack we got on Lufthansa was multi grain bread and cheese which was quite good. The meal was very good as well and was hot. They followed the meal with an after dinner drink of Bailey's or a brandy which was also an unexpected nice touch. The gentlemen who took care of us on the flight were very kind and attentive. So, overall, I'd give them a 5 star plus and would fly with them again if we ever get the chance.

But as it would prove later, this was not due to Lufthansa.Boarding went smooth and hassle free.The flight to Frankfurt left with a fifteen minute delay.There is very little to say about the very short flight from Brussels to Frankfurt. On the outbound flight they managed just to give everyone a bag of nuts and a drink. You can hardly call it comfortable, the seats on the Airbus A319 they use for these short flights,. Still, with a flight time of just an hour this is not really a problem.The crew was polite and correct, but given the short time frame in which they had to perform their duties, not very sympathetic towards the passengers. Yet, no complaints for such a short flight.

The service was not that good, I have had much better service on other LH flights. Felt like the flight attendant didn't realy paid a lot of attention to his customers.

What I like with Lufthansa: I never ever get the feeling that someone looks sharply at me when I have maybe a laptop bag or something more additional with me. Once my suitcase weighted some hundred gramm to much but they did not charge me anything extra (maybe they saw that I fly regularly or they knew that they did not have so many suitcases that day). ""Mandatorily"" free soft drinks, beer & wine as welll as a sandwich/cake I like. The new price politics caused higher prices on my air route, I don't appreciate that.

Wished that the cabin crew would have done something about it.Transiting was easy and lucky none of my luggage were lost.'Flying back to Kuala Lumpur, I was seated next a talkative Malaysian who was always poking my arms. Not the flight's fault but at times I wish that the passengers were more considered. I was already dead tired (it was a night flight) and was waiting to get home.Again, no luggage were lost!Overall, satisfied with the service.

The overall experience was fairly good. The seating was not so good as it had very less leg space. Meals provided were fresh with average taste. There was a good selection of movies to watch at the in-flight entertainment. The staff were helpful but seemed always busy. Compared to other international airlines, I felt Lufthansa was one of the better ones, if not the best. Overall, I am giving a 3 rating.

Many years I flew Business with Senator Card Status- but after my retirement I am not a frequent Flyer anymore. I was always hesitating to spend the extra money for the ticket in Premium Economy- but I have to say- this money is well spend!!! I mangaged To doze off for the first Time in Economy and the extra legroom with the foot Rest is just fab:) I arrived without swollen feat and also I dis not struggle with Jetlag as much.Besides the more comfortable Seat- the A380 is less noisy & I had the the feeling that air quality is much better.Curious to test the Premium Economy in other aircraft types as well !!!

LH (Lufthansa) is by far an airline you feel as if you are at your destination before you take off. The comfort is second to none, and you feel safe and sound the whole flight through. I have flown LH countless of times and can't say enough good about it. I have flown in economy as well, and have to say, for the money it's very good as well.

Despite the number of folks on the plane thus a lot of folks at the gate, it is a great plane to fly in. Roomy and much quieter than other planes due to the added insulation. We have flown in other A380s on long hauls, mainly with Emirates or Air France. All have been so much nicer than in 777s or 747s. Give it a shot, not so bad. If you can get premium economy it is worth it.

On board comfort, service and amenities have deteriorated significantly over the years. Still, if safety is the first concern, as it should be, it comes down to only one choice, Lufthansa or its subsidiaries, Swiiss and Austrian (do not know much about Air Brussels). German Wings, the other affiliate, has, obviously, some open questions. Upgrades, amenities exceedingly difficult to obtain on Lufthansa. Lufthansa concentrates saving on passenger comfort and satisfaction. Safety,on Lufthansa is good as they come. Also, Lufthansa offered special services on this in Frankfurt (private escorted transport) so as not to miss the connecting flight to Budapest

Was flying with my son (who has just hit his 22 month milestone) on a long haul flight. During check-in, my request for a bassinet seat was not successful because these special seats were supposedly occupied by other babies who had checked in before us. The row behind the bassinet row was offered to us. Upon boarding the plane, I observed that the ""babies"" who were assigned the bassinet row, were actually adult males and females without kids. As expected, without a bassinet, my 22-month old could not sleep well and was cranky. Eventually, one of those adults seated in the bassinet row, turned around and screamed, ""Both of you, stop it!"" at us. It was an extremely stressful situation since my son was not at the age where you could reason with him. Desperate, I carried the 22 month old to the pantry to avoid further confrontation with that particular adult male. At this point, one of the stewardess approached us and said, ""You can't stand here cos I need to sleep.""  Worst flight ever... Confirmed. Could not sit down and no where to stand..."

They used to be great now they might be the best option but they are going back to the pack. They've switched to older less comfortable planes, the food is not as good as it used to be, and it seems like the flight attendants care less than they used to. Also now they charge for booking your seat when you buy the ticket.

The business class cabin (A380) was everything you expect to find at this level. Cabin service was extremely good and food and beverage as good as it gets. Seat and bed extension were both comfortable. Entertainment system good with noise cancelling headphones. Adequate storage facilities within the seat area and all within reach. This is what a Business Class cabin should be...
401053930;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;May 16;3;International;Economy;Rio de Janeiro;Frankfurt;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;I was excited to fly the newest version of the Boeing 747, the 747-8 Intercontinental. We left Rio around 10 o'clock at night and arrived on time in Frankfurt the following afternoon. I researched seats beforehand and picked 16K, a window seat behind business class. It was a very good with enough room behind the bulkhead that I didn't to wake up the folks beside me when stepping into the aisle. The flight attendants were friendly and prompt with requests and the meal was tasty for economy class. The latest version of the 747 is beautiful, with lots of overhead space. I wish other airlines were using this plane.
401049333;Lufthansa;3;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Economy;Atlanta;Frankfurt;2;3;3;3;4;4;4;When traveling economy class, my expectations are never really high. However, I expect flights lasting 9 hours to be a bit more accommodating and considerate of their passengers. The seats were small with very little legroom. There are no passenger operated air vents to control airflow. At times the plane would get too warm and there was no way to alleviate the heat. Although there seemed to be a good selection of movies and shows to watch, I was not fortunate enough to have a working screen. The staff was adequate. They weren't rude but didn't seem particularly happy in their job.

The seats were very comfortable and adjustable. A convenience package on every seat provided socks to keep your feet warm, a blanket, pillow and eye mask. Sleep like a baby.Inflight beverages and meals were delicious and provided healthy options too.

401042636;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Business Class;Newark;Frankfurt;5;5;5;4;4;3;5;I've discovered that Lufthansa has gotten rid of its old, grumpy ways, replacing that with friendly, helpful and (of course) efficient cabin attendants. The food is first rate (they do beef and seafood especially well) and the wine list usually offers a pleasant surprise. Breakfasts, however, are nothing special.Seats lie flat for a comfortable nap, even if the flight is too short for real sleep.Long story short: Lufthansa has now become my airline of choice between the US and Europe and/or the Middle East (If only the pricing were lower...)

Given that we hadn't been to Europe for a few years we treated ourselves to this luxury. NOT! We were very disappointed with the entire experience, from not getting the meals we expected, to not having a chair/bed that actually folded down, to having the flight attendant believing that the fellow sitting next to my wife was me (she obviously did't look at the seating manifest to realize that I was sitting in a seat that wasn't next to my wife, ergo, the stranger got the last preferred meal leaving my wife and I to take a sad pasta dish). It's disappointing to think that for the extra money we could not get a meal that reflected Business Class standards.Overall, having flown Lufthansa previously, we believe the standard of service and the lack of Business class food options was not up to snuff and were very disappointed with the whole experience. We will have difficulty traveling to Europe with this company again.

Got to fly on the new Airbus a380 (seat 12c),from the NYC to FRA leg and really enjoyed the flight. Lufthansa, as you go through to check all the boxes on which you find it a good airline, checks them all.Boarding: Boarded a double decker Airbus in record time. That's all about trained personnel doing their jobs.Seats: Pretty standard economy seating. Not bad, not great. Meals: Served promptly for dinner, then at waking time for breakfast about 90 min. out. I've found this helps tremendously for overnight flight sleeping time, and I really appreciate the efforts. A cocktail hour is announced before dinner, and they then buy you a cocktail. Never a bad thing. Meal quality: Above average for coach. It's all basically a tv dinner in back in coach, but the bread was fresh, the salad was crisp, and the entree was not bad.IFE: Good sized screen, many entertainment choices, interactive gps map to track your trip, and outside cameras to view the trip from many spots outside of the aircraft, (the tail camera was my favorite).Cleanliness: spotless throughout. Impressive. Flight attendants: As a whole, helpful, courteous, efficient, and they actually smiled at people. Unheard of. I think American Airlines trains their people to have that sour look on their faces. Luggage: No baggage fee for international travel, and always showed up when it was supposed to be there. All good. Customer service: They got us out of Turkey when we were stuck behind hurricane Sandy, and supposed to connect through JFK, back to SEA when things were in chaos, when thousands were stranded. All the service related personnel, from flight attendants to reps were outstanding. It's a pleasure to fly on an airline when people like their jobs. Arrival/departure: ON Time. Period. Gotta love the Germans. In closing, if I'm headed the same way they're going, they'll always be first choice.

There was no in-flight entertainment to speak of, besides some in-flight magazines, but no screens, music, films...The food was ok, but rather small and cold ( a sandwich or something similar).Variety of drinks was narrow.The flight attendants were ok but not too forthcoming or warm.All in all, it was a rather average experience in all aspects.

So i can talk a bit bout short and long flights. The short flights are mostly done with smaller planes, being a tall person its not easy because the leggspace is very small. I always try to get an exitseat before check in and sometimes it works so thats kind of a relief. They give a drink and a small snack, nothing special in fact. Staff is friendly. On the long flight i was really disappointed and it convinced me a bit not to take Lufthansa for long flights. Crew is friendly and helpfull but seats are so so and the food they serve is nothing special, close to bad. You get like a box where everything is packed. Simple food, nothing nice really. I missed once my flight to Singapore with SIA because of a delay of their flight, the rebooking was already done when i arrived but then waiting for 10 hrs and got 10 euro for a snack and a drink. Afterwards i filed a complaint and they just said it was not their fault, blamed it on the Luggage handlers. When i wrote to SIA i got a small compensation eventough they had nothing to do with it...that is service !!...Lufthansa can learn from that if it wants to stay a 5* airline.
401017723;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Apr 16;4;International;Premium Economy;Denver;Frankfurt;3;5;4;3;4;3;3;"We booked Premium Economy because of some traveler reviews on line. The seats were definitely more comfortable than Economy, but the Premium Economy cabin is not separated from regular economy and there was lots of traffic as a result. Food was OK, alcohol plentiful, but what seemed to set this class of service apart was the superb service provided by our flight crew. When booking, the bulkhead seats we wanted were not available, which was the case on every DEN-FRA flight we checked for the entire month. Leads me to believe the bulkhead seats are somehow ""reserved"" by the airline. Overall, this class of service was better than Economy, but may not have the same value for others. It was substantially more expensive than Economy, but certainly less than the next option - Business. Check in was a total disaster - just a mob pushing and shoving with no regard for seat numbers, etc. Lufthansa's gate crews badly need training."
401012097;Lufthansa;3;03.08.16;May 16;3;International;Premium Economy;Newark;Frankfurt;4;2;4;4;4;2;3;We flew in one of the very large fleet of planes that had a second level of just business class. The configuration for the Premium Economy was very odd. There were several rows of Economy in front of us, and the Premium Economy seats were over the wings. The roomier seats were very nice, however, there were definitely not enough flight attendants on the plane. I actually waited almost 1/2 hour after I signaled for a flight attendant before one came. Because there are Economy seats in front of you, it doesn't put you in a good position when getting off the plane. When we were standing in the isle to get off the plane some woman kept pushing my daughter. We told her there was no where to go and to stop pushing. The flight attendant just stood watching this happen until we asked her to intervene.

Basically our return flight to Dulles is business but we needed to fly in coach for the short hop from Budapest to Frankfurt. Checking in at the Budapest airport @ 8 AM on a Sunday was complete chaos. The departure area is not big enough for the number of Lufthansa passengers checking in for their flights. We were in the regular line until I asked one of the Lufthansa reps available to answer questions whether we should check in via the business class line since our flight back to the US from Frankfurt was business class( & our checked luggage would fall under the business requirements, not the coach ones). She wasn't sure but then allowed us to stand in the much shorter line (though it was slow going as well) - the gentleman issuing our boarding passes and taking our checked luggage had no issues w/ us being in the business line so I don't know why the Lufthansa rep wasn't sure. The reps were clustered amongst themselves and not really working w/ passengers to answer questions. One gentleman was trying to get through, his flight was in a hour and she just told him that he had plenty of time and just needed to wait in line(he still had to go through security). Finally we got our boarding passes, the gentleman taking care of it was very efficient, we got through security (w/ me being patted down because of my replaced knee setting off the alarm but the security woman was very nice and was humorous about it - saying I was just getting my AM massage - she was very through but I didn't have a problem w/ that. Got onto the flight and in a very efficient manner, the flight crew got us all seated and we pulled away from the gate, on time. Even though it was a short flight we got a drink & snack - coach seats actually were roomy, much more leg room than in United coach. Once in Frankfurt we looked for the Lufthansa Club lounge since we had a bit of a wait and w/ our business boarding passes we are permitted to use their lounge. Nice lounge, showers are available, very clean bathrooms, a wide variety of free alcohol including hard liquor, wine(including sparkling), & beer on tap. They served a vegetarian stew and had sausages as well. Plenty of snacks and fruits too. I would rate them higher w/ the exception of the messy check-in in Budapest.

I wish I had taken a sleeping pill to get through the plane ride. The person behind me was trying to stretch out leaving his arms on the top of my seat. A kid started planing the game trouble behind my husband seats at 2 am with the light on. It was a plain miserable flight. The food was ok but so hard to eat because of the limited space you had. My husband also cut his hand getting our carry on luggage out and the stewardace told us there a first aid at the airport but didn't know where. All we wanted was a band aide and clean up the blood. I guess we know we were not in the USA anymore.
400996222;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Washington;Frankfurt;4;4;4;4;5;3;3;Lufthansa's premium economy beats US carriers to Europe hands down. Lufthansa currently uses a 747 on IAD-FRA route but note that on the -400 version premium economy is behind business and in front of economy while on the -800 version premium economy is strangely located between a small economy class section and in front of the main economy section. Seats are wide--instead of 3 on the aisle there are just 2 and lots of leg room even with seat reclined in row in front. There is no dedicated premium economy check in or early boarding. You get a printed menu, but it's the same as the economy menu, a welcome drink (juice) before takeoff, toiletry kit, bottled water at your seat, and an plug for electronic devices. Otherwise it is the same as regular economy, but cabin crew treat you a bit nicer. The fare is notably higher than regular economy, but the extra leg room and wider seats were worth it for us. Lufthansa's on demand AV system is fantastic, food service is quite good, and the aircraft offers WiFi but we didn't try it.

The service was well below par. They served the drinks and disappeared into economy. As the lady behind me said, ""What do you have to around here to get a drink"". The Purser seemed to be running back and forth and did everything he could to avoid eye contact. Getting new supplies for the trolley, heating a babies bottle. Hello!! Did he forget us? It seemed like it. Normally I have nothing but praise for Lufthansa but on this occasion their service fell well below par. Thinking how much the fare was, I was very disappointed. I got the impression that he was trying to keep economy happy because we were late taking off. This was at the expense of the business class passengers. I am not saying he should neglect economy but were were paying for the service we did not really get. *** I would suggest if you want something you should activate the overhead buzzer. The guy behind me did this and got what he wanted. ***I could complain t0 Lufthansa but they never seem to react to anything. I wrote to tell them of a great flight we had to Mallorca and the only reply was they received my E-mail. Enough said."

From the start the staff knew my name and spoke to me in English, the person beside me in German and I heard at least 1 other language close by. The food service was delicious and the facilities on the plane were spot on. The seat was very comfortable and could go to completely flat for sleeping. A proper pillow and blanket made the experience comfortable and refreshing.

400976849;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;First Class;Chicago;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;what can one expect less than a pleasant flight in first class? So it was, but not only the first class service made the flight pleasant. The flight was about 30mins late due to bad weather, but made it on time to Frankfurt. It was bumpy, but that was nature's prerogative. Take off and landing was elegant, information from the flight desk precise. Ground service in Frankfurt very fast. Not so fine, the lounge in Chicago (United) crowded and not well designed.

Seats on the 747 (upper deck) were spacious, lots of room between them (its a 2/2 configuration) and the service was prompt, charming and attentive. Very comfortable flat beds that somehow felt better than others I've been on. Wide entertainment possibilities. My #1 choice if I have to redo.

The service is good - plane is very clean - departure times on time.American based airlines need to take some lessons from the European carriers.I hate to be unsupportive, but my money and the price I have to pay allows me to be critical!

400953346;Lufthansa;3;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Economy;Johannesburg;Frankfurt;3;4;4;2;2;2;3;So I have flown this route for the last three years several times a year for work. Things are changing at Lufthansa and not for the better. Packed like sardines, adult males do not fit in the new LH config. Worse, no predinner or mid-flight drink service...so you sit with a meal waiting for 15 minutes to get your first and only drink service....meal was unremarkable, movies were all ones seen, person behind me was tapping into the not so sensitive touch screen (my head rest) all night. Misery, at 3K Euro (Y class).
400951410;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Dec 15;8;Europe;Economy;Nice;Frankfurt;3;5;;;3;5;;Well what can I say on an express Lufthansa flight: the price was ok, space reduced and luggage expensive to take (sold separately). This is the best flight to Germany from Nice paying a correct value for the distance, thus I give 4 stars. Also the attention was great, flying with kids is really comfortable with the help you get. Just the no luggage politics is something I don't agree on (but you can buy some for this with an extra cost) and that the children's price reduction is not sufficient - there are better airlines in this regards. All in all recommended considering it's a low fare and short trip.
400948242;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Economy;Prague;Frankfurt;4;5;5;3;;5;5;Great German efficiency, cleanliness, and very kind flight attendants. The food looked good, but they only had things that I couldn't eat because of allergies.

You receive a choice of magazines and a small nice breakfast. Although only 9 pax in business class forgot to offer drinks to me and my travel companion. That felt a bit odd. But overall a decent ecperience.

I had some bad food before entering into the plane. In just 2-3 minutes I had the worst and fastest vomit I ever had. I made it into the restrom at the end of the plane. After 2 hours the most friendliest flight attendant you can ever imagine helped me with new cloth (there was no way I could use my own 
400940868;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Mar 16;5;International;Premium Economy;Los Angeles;Frankfurt;4;4;4;2;4;4;3;I see disappointing reviews based on coach seating. I do not think that CLASS should dictate your experience on a flight, but we do live in the real world. Long haul from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. We had a designated boarding line and when on board a comfortable seat with a foot rest when reclined. The seats were roomy and plenty of leg space. We had a designated section of the cabin with only about 40 seats and a designated flight attendant. Food was forgettable but they offered snacks and drinks on demand. As we flew overnight we slept and didn't really care about the food.We actually had a very pleasant experience and arrived refreshed. Also love the two free checked bags per person. No complaints here and will fly with Lufthansa to Europe again.
400940155;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;Business Class;Chicago;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;Recently flew Business Class on Lufthansa from Chicago to Frankfurt round trip. Service was great. My only complaint was I had only 55 minutes to change planes in Frankfurt, which included going thru Passport Control. Had to run all the way. 55 minutes us not really enough time to change planes when having to go through Passport Control. Otherwise the flight and service was very good.
400939936;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Economy;London;Frankfurt;3;5;5;4;;5;4;Flying almost every two weeks these days and LH is always my preferred airline. Mostly in time and above all I feel safe. Sandwiches and drinks absolutely perfect for the fare you pay.
400939734;Lufthansa;3;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Business Class;Venice;Frankfurt;3;5;4;3;1;3;3;A relatively short flight (1h15m) over the Alps on a breakfast flight leaving Venice at 7.00am.The service was impeccable, the food quite pasable in a homogenised kind of way, and the awful European habit of making Business Class seats by keeping empty the middle of three adjacent economy seats softened by the seats being divided only by an armrest than could be raised at will unlike those (say, Aer Lingus, or Alitalia, or British Airways, etc) that have fixed hard side walls that squeeze us all in like sardines.What a shame we were in transit at Frankfurt Main for four hours, a most unpleasant circus of an airport.

I have flown many times by lufthansa airlines and its always been a good experience. Recently our flight got cancelled and we were put up in lufthansa airlines as compensation.

The cabin crew was fluent in English (though it was fun to hear them talk to each other in German.... probably something along the lines of 'look at that silly Canadian, like a kid in a candy store on this plane'...). Of note while airborne was the dramatic upward tilt of the wing, just like in the Boeing promotional photos and paintings
400933570;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Feb 16;6;International;Business Class;Toronto;Frankfurt;4;4;4;3;3;3;4;Pretty good seating arrangement. And the food was not half bad. The stewards and stewardesses was fairly friendly and would come by occassionally to ensure that I was comfortable. Used to get a bit of work done overnight and then would be ready for work a few hours later. So that was useful, as was the Wifi.
400932467;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Aug 16;0;Europe;Economy;London;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;Good. Good food on long haul flight. Excellent staff. Neat and clean toilets. The only problems were due to the airports not having space for parking. Taking ages to taxi the plane and not fueling the plane quickly.

We have 2 kids and the gate attendants let us board early so it was a big plus for us. The food is really bad, we were left with no choice even though we didn't really sit at the back. They do have a better variety of non-alcoholic drink (I like the bitter lemon). The entertainment system has pretty good selection of movies.I recommend ordering special meals for kids if possible.
400928150;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Apr 16;4;International;Economy;Houston;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;"Friends of ours and we have taken this flight roundtrip three times now. Even coach in a fairly lengthy flight has always been pleasant. The key is to get in the last or tail section. (This is counterintuitive, but the tail section is supposed to be safest, anyway). In addition, if one does not mind being last to deplane, this section can be less crowded but still has enough attendants to provide unexpectedly good service. There are multiple restrooms at the very tail and most people in the forward economy section do not venture that far back (the galley with curtains on either side between the forward and tail economy sections discourages them). Departure and arrival times are convenient.Flight is also code share for United. Disadvantages when purchasing tickets through UAL: reserving seat assignments can be tricky (Lufthansa considers your assignment a ""request"" not a confirmed assignment. Ach, Ich verstehen das nicht!) and getting mileage credit consistently takes extra effort. Both could be resolved with little effort by Lufthansa and United."

So I was a happy camper. No lie flat seats or anything like that. But a wider seat, more legroom, more recline, and a bit extra service. As a United 1K flyer, Lufthansa treats me pretty well. Flight was on schedule and the service was quite good.

I really wish some of the flight attendants smile a little more or show that they are somewhat happy to do their job but it seems too much to ask at times from some of them. That being said, the service was very quick and efficient. The plane was clean but the seats very tight together and very restricted leg room even with Economy Plus. The gate agents also need to work on their customer skills as they get short in a hurry. I did love their inflight entertainment though which had plenty to keep me busy for the 9 1/2 hour flight. I will fly them again and maybe try their business class next time.

I had accepted the upgrade offer I had received via e-mail and something had gone wrong. I was told that I was booked economy next day from Oslo to Frankfurt and not paid upgrade, though it was charged to my credit card. Called Swiss Senator service, called LH customer service and finally Senator service in Germany - bingo. Friendly lady, yes there is a problem and it is now fixed.Next morning - your ticket to Frankfurt is invalid. You cannot check-in, so I had to rush to the train dragging my bag with me. Called LH Senator service - we have fixed it and it will work. I was already planning my complaint, but to make the long story short - I got on the flight without any further issues and the service was outstanding. Crew was super friendly, smiles and was addressed by name. I fully and completely enjoyed my upgrade, the service and it completely changed my perspective. Yes, there were issues, and it was a pain to bring the bag through Oslo on the train, but the excellent service on the flight made up for it. Well done Lufthansa - goes to prove that excellent service can make up for a poor experience.

Positive to mention that you normally feel always save on board and it is really clean. Onboard Internet is working excellent. Negative to mention is that I get all the time the same food served. LH seems to have a standard menu on their sectors and this stays for years. Also negative is the very, very tight space they provide in normal Economy Class.In the Premium Economy the space offer is much better but the food topic remains the same.

We have never been disappointed. This flight was no exception. As we were the only guests in first class which can accommodate 8 we were pampered more than normal.

400911176;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Aug 16;0;Europe;Economy;London;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;;5;5;I booked via a third party company as I couldn't seem to get the dates and right times I wanted via the Lufthansa site. That said it integrated seemlessly onto the Lufthansa site. I was told by Lufthansa I had booked a light flight which meant I only had booked a small hand luggage allowance. As the flight was pretty cheap I booked extra baggage and paid in advance to make sure I got an aisle seat. This was reasonably priced as far as I was concerned and worth it. Communication, check in online, and general information was excellent. Staff were helpful and efficient and it was a good experience especially as I don't like changing planes. Only surprise was the poor selection of shops at Frankfurt airport, not a patch on Munich.

We had long haul flight with bad service and they treated us badly, although we had our children and one of them iwas 5 years old. That is because we are Middle Easterns. They treated the passenger next to us politely and differently. My child had to use the toilet and they prevented my wife from taking her as the plane was descending, a few seconds later they allowed a european passenger to use it. Even at the airport, my wife went to ask their help desk about the gate for our next flight and she shouted at her and told her rudely to keep looking at the monitors. I filed a complaint, but again they didn't bother to answer. We felt the discrimination all through even at the management level.We took a decision not to fly with lufthansa even if they were the only airline available. I can tolerate bad seat, bad food but I can't tolerate discrimination. It has been a while and we just can't forget."

The European ones tend to remember that passengers are actually paying customers and deserve to be treated as such.

The service on board was excellent, friendly and experienced. The food was very good, fresh as far as it is possible on a plane. The seats / beds are very good and offer enough space. The bathroom of this 747 cannot compare with the A380, but is good enough. Entertainment variety is excellent and there are enough magazines. This first class is a class better than Swiss or Turkish.

I experienced the best service I have ever had in the air. At no time did the flight attendant roll her eyes or make the famous flight attnedant sigh when a request was made by a customer. She even smiled not once but often, and a real one. The food was not only eatable, it was very good and enough. Even though the internet was not functioning, I could not have left this flight a bigger fan.

Checkin at Ohare was very smooth even though our tickets were booked under 3 different confirmation numbers. The staff was very polite and efficient and gave us our boarding passes for both legs of our trip.Onboard we received drinks and dinner. The beer was free and the dinner was adequate. We flew on a 747 and the plane offered plenty of free movies and tv shows to keep my whole family entertained. Before landing we received breakfast sandwiches and coffee/juice/tea. The flight landed on time and our luggage was transferred to our connecting flight without a problem.

We were offered warm clothes to freshen our faces, offered beverages often and were served a fabulous dinner. The attendants were attentive and friendly and always available. Our flight was uneventful and we had plenty of movies, music and flight maps and info to keep us entertained and informed. One very pleasant surprise upon arrival at Frankfurt and exiting the plane, was a woman there to hand us a long stemmed red rose and a thank you for flying Lufthansa. Next trip to Germany, we'll choose them again !
400887292;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;May 16;3;International;Premium Economy;Toronto;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;My husband and I flew to Germany to celebrate a good friend's 70th birthday and to spend some time on the Bodensee visiting family. We decided to give Lufthansa a try and were not disappointed. We booked Premium Economy and it was very nice. The seats are bigger with more leg room, only downside was when the person in front of you puts their seat back you lost space. Food and service were good. Staff were very helpful. Love that you have your own TV with access to movies anytime. It is great on a long haul flight to be able to watch a movie when you want (if you can't sleep, etc). We were very fortunate on our way home to be upgraded to Business Class. That was a huge treat. The cabin class is unbelievable and service impeccable. Great food, sekt and wine, liqueurs. Staff were great. It was such a treat to have a fully reclinable seat and a great nap on the way home after a very busy 4 week vacation. Would highly recommend Lufthansa and definitely fly with them again.

400880770;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;Economy;New York;Frankfurt;4;4;5;4;4;4;5;Lufthansa is a good airline. Not great, but good. Seats are tight but service is prompt and friendly. Planes feel modern and clean, unlike some discount airlines. Drinks are all free and offered often. Paying for seats with extra legroom is definitely worth it.

The relation price/quality is nice but you have to book in advance,because these flights are very expensive 1 week before the flight. On board thou always have snacks and beverage included in the flight price. Out there're snack enough you can ask to Havre another one for free. Very nice company! !!
400877724;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;May 16;3;International;Premium Economy;Toronto;Frankfurt;4;5;4;4;4;5;4;The day started out poorly leaving Pittsburgh. The Air Canada counter had no one to check us in until under two hours to flight time. The flight to Toronto was on a small jet--uneventful and only a little late. The good part of the trip was the 747 Lufthansa plane which was the transatlantic portion of the trip. Lots of legroom in the Premium Economy, a drink before takeoff, great attention to details. Next time, I'll try to book with Lufthansa for this type of trip.
400877468;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Apr 16;4;International;Economy;Denver;Frankfurt;3;5;5;5;4;5;5;The plane is very large and the seats were fairly comfortable for the long flight that it was. My only complaint was the occupant of the seat behind me was doing their best to kick my seat and push into it and they weren't young children. The service was excellent and the attendants were friendly and very considerate.
400873751;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;Premium Economy;San Francisco;Frankfurt;5;5;5;;5;5;5;Selected Lufthansa to fly to Europe based on required arrival time to meet up with other family already there. We paid the $100 to upgrade to Premium Economy--rather than upgrade to Business Class for another $5,000--and could not be happier we made that choice. I am now obese and find airline travel anxiety-ridden, but the accommodations and comfort made this trip a pleasure. The aircraft was clean and the crew could not have been more accommodating. Based on three near-perfect flights over a 23 day period, I highly recommend Lufthansa for your travel needs. (And go with the extra cost for Premium Economy if you can afford it.)
400873663;Lufthansa;2;03.08.16;Jun 16;2;Europe;Economy;St. Petersburg;Frankfurt;3;1;3;2;1;1;2;We flew with LH to Russia and back but were left utterly gobsmacked by the attitude. The service was not so bad but I made the decision not to use this airline again unless I really do have no choice.Being sat in the middle of the plane alas meant that by the time the drinks trolley came the red wine bottle was almost empty and I got a dribble. Tough luck I felt but then I could see that a second round of wine was being served nearer the front (not first class) and yet when I raised this point I got told none for you by the rather exasperated attendent. Charming! but well that is often the case with German service and I didn't really take it personally.But then we were delayed due to weather (now this can't be helped) but were told 'Well everyone else is going to be late so it is all fine for connections' which really irked as we had now missed 2 connecting trains (which were not affected by the weather). We then missed further connections as the bus door from the plane broke and we were left on the runway for 20 mins in the rain as getting a new bus was not really a priority.A poor non-German speaking passenger was even screamed at to get off the bus into the rain - pointless as the bus was going nowhere.The attitude from the staff was 'well you have been delivered and are here now so what more do you want?'Gee I dunno, a working bus, you know, might just be of some use? Other issues at the airport - beyond Lufthansa's control but added to the general malaise of the whole experience - made the journey the second worst I have ever been on but what topped it all was the following Monday the CEO of Lufthansa telling us on the BBC 'passengers have never had it so good' despite our plane tickets costing 3 times what we paid for the same journey but from London with BA 18 months previously.Well Lufthansa, thanks but I think in future I will use an airline that doesn't treat me with such arrogant contempt.

400872149;Lufthansa;1;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Economy;Manchester;Frankfurt;2;2;2;1;1;1;2;I would go out of my way not to fly with Lufthansa in the future.I made a business booking for four clients and one was unwell to travel and requested change of name on the date of departure, not possible and had to pay over å£700.00 for a new flight, the new passenger was already on his way to the airport and had no option.I wrote to Lufthansa and was advised this was company policy, not good especially as I work for a German company.Flight both ways was also delayed, 45 minutes going, 95 minutes coming home.

400868531;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;May 16;3;Europe;Economy;Budapest;Frankfurt;4;3;5;5;2;5;5;The economy class is maybe twice as expensive than a low cost flight (depends a lot on your luck though when you book ticket), but ten times better: comfortable, they give snack and they treat passangers nicely.
400598497;Lufthansa;3;02.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Economy;London;Frankfurt;3;2;3;3;2;2;1;We had 1 hour to change flights in Frankfurt, which should be no problem, but the plane parked far away on a ramp, instead of at a gate. We had to wait for 15 minutes for the buses to arrive and then another 20 minutes for the bus to drive, another 10 minutes, to the terminal. This is unacceptable for a major German airline. What happened to German efficiency and punctuality?

400055668;Lufthansa;3;01.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;Economy;Los Angeles;Frankfurt;3;3;5;2;4;2;5;Seats were reasonably comfortable. Leg room was acceptable, though not great. The 747-8 aircraft was just a few years old and the cabin in good repair. The touch screens are finicky and slow to respond to touch. So I had the pleasure of someone trying to get their touchscreen to respond by hitting the back of my seat ever harder. Service was a bit inconsistent. During regular service passes, the crew was polite and efficient. Outside of those times, it was difficult to get their attention to get an extra soda for example. The liquor selection in coach is very limited (e.g., no bourbon, only scotch) and there is only one type of beer (Warsteiner, which I don't care for). Ridiculously, LH charges extra for seat reservation in coach.
399990742;Lufthansa;3;01.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Business Class;Barcelona;Frankfurt;2;3;4;1;1;3;3;"Thanks to the Lufthansa App the check-in was easy. When dropping off the check-in luggage no information of how and where to find the Business Lounge were provided.After security check I tried to find the lounge. But the airport obviously tries to keep people in the airport shopping centre, instead of helping them to ""escape"" immediately to the lounge. The signs are unclear (if any) and it is unclear which way to go. There is no Lufthansa or Star Alliance lounge. But one of the lounges that has ""Lufthansa"" listed, among many other airlines, on a sign. The waiting time to get in was horrible....as many other customers tried to get in and had long discussions and payment processes before me.The lounge was dirty from pervious customers and no staff was initally visible to clean it. The ""buffet"" for snacks was completely empty, only after maybe 1 hours one delivered few sandwiches after some other customers had complained to the front desk.The boarding process was unclear. Where the monitor showed ""Business Class / Star Alliance Gold...etc)"" the Economy passengers were boarding, and vice versa. It caused confusion among the passengers and useless discussions.The aircraft, almost 23 years old and tired. Particularly the noise of the engines during take off was scary, due to the age of the aircraft. The seat pitch - typical for A321 (A320 is better) was horrible, particularly considering this should be Business Class. Standard of Ryanair (or maybe worse). The standard Lufthansa seats in Europe anyhow remind me more of camping chairs than of comfortable seats. Also they almost do not recline.As usual in Lufthansa, no welcome drink on the ground.No choice of food. Only cold food, and optimised for cost and weight. What you get is basically a ""do it yourself sandwich"". Also, as usual for Lufthansa, no choice for wine. It is either red or white. The white wine (GrÌ_ner Veltliner) should be served together with tablets against heart burn. Horrible. The red wine was better, but not good.The pilot announced ""light turbulences"" over France, switched on the fasten seat belt signs. But why he told the customers ""LIGHT"" turbulences and at the same time the purser urged the cabin crew to stop service and take a seat did not fit together. In fact after switching on the fasten seat belt signs the turbulences were less then before. It did not give the impression that the crew had a good knowledge of what they are doing in this respect.The arrival was on time, the luggage arrived relatively quickly in Frankfurt.As always with Lufthansa, nothing pleasant, but it works."

Beverages & food are tasty and a wide variety of shows to watch, in one word ....good service, enough comfortable flight, departs arrivals on time, no reason to complain, next year I'll fly by Lufthansa too.
398827368;Lufthansa;5;29.07.16;Jun 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Washington;Frankfurt;4;4;4;4;4;5;5;We chose the premium economy for the extra room, extra luggage, and the business class lounge access for an additional $30, perhaps the most important. The Dulles lounge is excellent in both food and drinks and provides you the opportunity for early direct boarding along with the business class passengers. The Frankfurt lounge is not as good and does not offer the pre-boarding benefit but still may be worth the money. On board 419/418 service is nothing special so you should take full advantage of the lounge services including restrooms before you board. Food could have been better and I was also disappointed with the beef tips which were tough. You will do better with the pasta both going and coming. You will also be offered an opportunity to bid for business class upgrade for better accommodations and sleeping. Could be a good value on the way over but not for a day time return on 418. If you bid you should bid below their suggested price but check seat availability first.

We wanted to experience flying on an Airbus 380 aircraft and Lufthansa offered a non-stop to Frankfurt. The plane is enormous. Passengers must embark and disembark on two levels. Economy is on the first level while first class, business class and some economy plus seats are on the second level. My wife and I purchased economy plus tickets and were lucky to be seated on the upper level at the rear of the aircraft on the left side. There were about 10 rows of economy plus seats at the rear on the second level. This aircraft is amazing! For the size of its engines the inside cabin noise was minimal. On takeoff the 380 lumbers down the runway and gets airborne quite easily. A feature that I like was the cameras that are situated in the tail and underbelly of the aircraft. You can view your flight in the monitor that is situated in the seat ahead of you.The flight was over 8 hours so several meals were served. The food I must say was extremely good for airline food. It was served hot, was fresh and tasty. After each meal you are provided with a warm moist hand towel. Want a German beer, ask for one, it's included in the cost of you ticket.The flight attendant was attentive and polite. Excellent experience and I will definitely fly Lufthansa again when traveling to Germany.

We were in line for over three hours, of course the 1/3 of the people behind us waited even longer, to be rescheduled. We were offered warm bottles of water or small cans of Coke after 3 hours. We were not offered a place to stay and had to request that. My young nephew and I finally finished at the counter after 10 PM. There were no apologies (which would have gone a long way) for the cancellation or the long wait. We were rescheduled on an American Flight the next evening. This caused us to miss my nephew's high school graduation in Germany.We did fly Lufthansa back from Germany and found the flight to be comfortable.

We actually passed the flight crew who arrived at the gate to find out the flight was cancelled! In the meantime, I called my daughter to see if she could get me on another flight, which she did, leaving out of San Francisco later in the afternoon. When we got to check in, we had to get in line again waiting for the frantic check in people (all contract workers who knew nothing about what was going on). I finally went up and asked how I could get my luggage back - no answer - and that they were waiting from word from Frankfort about the flight, about 20 more mins. Also, they had changed the flight from cancelled to delayed - and this is a key word because if the flight was merely delayed they could hold all the passengers and their luggage hostage until the flight was actually cancelled. This meant that if you found another flight, they wouldn't release you or your luggage because the flight was just ""delayed"". 45 mins later, still waiting for Frankfort to call back - mind you, this was a Boeing plane and Boeing is just down the road from SeaTac. By this time, it was being referred to a ""mechanical problem"" .....still waiting over an hour later....missed the flight to San Francisco because the Lufthansa flight was still delayed, not cancelled and that if I left my luggage for them to forward that I'd probably never see it again. Got to know all the other passengers very well, as we were all being held hostage. This was a jumbo jet and they wasn't more than a 100 or so people waiting so the general consensus was the plane wasn't delayed for ""mechanical problems"" but for a low census. Most of the other people were missing connecting flights because of the delay. Finally, after the flight's departure time, they announced that the flight was cancelled and someone would be passing out brochures and later that if you needed a hotel room, they would take care of that and probably if you need transportation back to Seattle, that could be arranged (I don't live in Seattle so would they only cover into the city and not to my home?) and that they were going to look for a replacement flight, sometime in the next 3 to 4 days! Look, I already know that they only have one flight a day to Frankfort and it's not a particular hot spot for travel from Seattle for other airlines. My daughter was still looking for a flight and came back to the airport to duke it out with the airline to release me and my bag. She had found another airline that was leaving later that evening and they agreed to hold a seat for me after hearing the story. By the time she arrived, Lufthansa had cancelled the flight and demanded that we go down to baggage claim to pick up our luggage immediately! I was able to get booked on the other airline, had to go through TSA again and hours after I had originally arrived at the airport, finally left for Germany. Oh, and the $100 upgrade on my reserved seat, no mention from Lufthansa on that or giving me a voucher for food and drinks at the airport as we were all held hostage. So unimpressed with Lufthansa and their lack of customer servlce! They should have had a supervisor there since the desk agents didn't know anything (remember, they were contract workers and had limited training), been honest about why the flight was ""delayed"" and been much more helpful to their customers - in my case - former customer. I would never recommend Lufthansa to anyone and one star is overrated."

Good idea.We bought exit row seats in Economy, which we liked better than Premium Economy. Friendly staff, good food, alcoholic drinks gratis ... nothing to complain about. Their Airbus 340 is a great plane, seating is perfect, as we prefer windows/aisle combination. So much better than the 3-4-3 configuration of a Boeing 787.3 weeks later we took a Lufthansa 747 to Canada, exit row seats again, same great overall experience.

Then during the following drinks service the guy initially serving business class took over (we were just a couple of row back from business class). He seemed more interested in spending a long time nattering with the woman in the row in front of us, then disappeared to get something, got sidetracked serving business class and eventually got around to serving us - ummmmm more lack of concentration.The final straw for this experience was landing in Frankfurt and pulled up to the gate, only to be told after a few minutes delay that we were parked on a Schengen stand but as we had originated from a non-Schengen country they had to await busses to offload us and take us to passport control but no busses were available at that time. Long story short it took 25 minutes after stopping at the gate to start getting us off the plane and onto the busses. Whilst not all our problems encountered were necessarily the direct fault of Lufthansa - and Frankfurt seemed a pretty much Lufthansa dominated airport - the whole experience was disappointing and its just lucky for us we didn't have a short connection or we'd have been in trouble.

Since it is a smaller plane, you cannot carry big hand luggage into the cabin. You need to give it just before boarding which is then put into the luggage gold. But, you can pick it up as soon as you get down the plane at Frankfurt. Also, in Frankfurt, the plane parks really far from the terminal building. It takes ~10 min by a bus to reach the terminal.

Internet support told us that there was plenty of space but youth can't be upgraded online. Tele sales (outsourced to India) wouldn't sell a cash upgrade as they told us there was no space... Uncoordinated and not very family friendly.Food service was rushed to the extreme. We got our food while taxiing in JFK and having the fasten seatbelt signs active. Discussion between male purser and stewardesses. He decided to push through with food and drink service. We got 8 min to eat a hot 3 course dinner. Neither safe nor pleasant. Food was the classic choice between chicken and pasta.Entertainment system in A380 takes significant space from all aisle and window seats. Still - the A380 experience is better than 777 due to reduced noise. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight. On arrival we found that Lufthansa had rebooked us on a tight connection by another carrier. That was actually the best part - and the only reason for choosing Lufthansa.

Reported the damage in the next second under scrutiny of the Austrian Airlines employee.

The baggage allowance is very less. Its only 23kgs per person. It should be atleast 30 kgs.2. The flight tickets are not cheap, they should reduce the prices and make flying more affordable.3. The in-flight meals are very bad, they can easily improve the quality of in-flight meals and the portions can be better. The sandwiches serves are pathetic and dry, Lufthansa needs a better consultant chef who can design their meals better.4. The economy seats are the worst I have flown, was not expecting this from Lufthansa specially when the brand is marketed as Nonstop You! Sorry to say this, but I have to stop, stretch and proceed - cannot be nonstop. Feels like a budget carrier.There is nothing that will make me come back to Lufthansa.
395936612;Lufthansa;4;23.07.16;Jul 16;0;International;Economy;Philadelphia;Frankfurt;2;5;4;3;4;3;3;This our first time flying with Lufthansa. We were seated close to the front of the widebody aircraft A340-300 (Seat 11 Economy Class). The on-board service was above average, friendly, and generous. This is something that you rarely get nowadays flying in economy class. The flight attendants were approachable and always had a smile in their face. They were willing to help and offer extra assistance for just about anything. I personally saw this when a couple flying with their baby needed assistance with the bassinet. There were no attitudes and no negativity compared to most American airline operators. Lavatories were always kept clean and well stocked with amenities. The aircraft was clean and had a pillow and blanket readily available on each seat as we boarded. The meals were average but were hot and were served with silverware not plastic. The overall flight was smooth and efficient. The only downside is the extremely uncomfortable seats. I am hoping that Lufthansa will do something about the seats.

395216009;Lufthansa;5;21.07.16;Jun 16;1;International;Economy;Denver;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;We have always been happy with the comfort and level of service in both economy and business on the non stop flight from Denver to Frankfurt. However, our major concern is the well being of our dogs, one in the cabin and one in the hold. Lufthansa does a fantastic job with care and consideration for both pets and their families. They are genuinely caring and even are happy to confirm your pet has been loaded in the holdso you know you will see them at your destination. The flight attendants always offer water to our dog in the cabin and strive to assure comfort during the long journey. For domestic travel we like Southwest but they only accept small pets in the cabin but none in the hold. Be sure to have all your pet's paperwork in order before flying.

Although seatrs are not much different to econ class, the middle seat is left empty and it feels okay for floights up to about 2-3 hours. Food and service all good for shorter flights, and main thing I find is that they are consistent in standards.
394079954;Lufthansa;4;18.07.16;Jun 16;1;International;Economy;Los Angeles;Frankfurt;4;4;4;3;4;4;4;Lufthansa runs a good airline. I have not had problems with the front desk or the flight attendants. I had a $150 baggage free for an overweight luggage. (Over 8 lbs) but once you pass the threshold, you have a lot of room (I had 15 more lbs I could have used). I believe the threshold was 21 kg. In flight entertainment was fine and the food is always satisfactory.

393943010;Lufthansa;2;18.07.16;Sep 15;10;International;Economy;Toronto;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;The plane is a 747-400. The Economy Class is really cramped if you are 6'1 like me. I had a window seat with a great view. Seating was 3 abreast. If you need the washroom, you better be prepared to line up and wait. Getting back to your seat after a washroom visit is lengthy is the service cart is in the aisle, You cannot pass it. There is no space. The entertainment system has everything you need to take your mind off the claustrophobic environment. Staff was very friendly. Food was good. .

The attendants were all really friendly and very very helpful. Our seats were comforable as well and we were were served nice meals as well. Even slightly overfed with 2 snacks as well as lunch and dinner, but thats what holidays are for. They also provided beverages frequently as well which was good.The only negative i have is, the earphones provided do not fit the earphone jack on the tablet device (screen on back of seat) so you have to watch movies with only 1 ear working. I would recommend takong your own earphones with you. Other than that, the movie and tv selection was good. We would both definetly fly Lufthansa again.

To start, the air conditioning was out in Houston to start - in July! - which makes for a miserable start. The entire flight was uncomfortably warm even though the AC was repaired. Only eight seats in First, but one's entertainment system didn't work. At least two of the seats malfunctioned on operation to lie flat. That being said, purser and attendants were great, and food was excellent.

We both have sleep difficulties (fragile sleep syndrome + use a CPAP) so we booked Lufthansa business class using United frequent flyer miles for the transatlantic flight (BOS-FRA). We arrived at BOS on separate connecting flights. Transferring from domestic to international terminals is very clumsy (you have to leave the secure area, then a long and poorly-signposted walk to the international terminal, then back in through the usual TSA security-theatre chaos).We had hoped to have dinner in the Lufthansa lounge so we could get more sleep on the plane, but the BOS Lufthansa lounge is pathetic -- small, crowded, and the food wasn't impressive. We ended up having dinner on the plane. :)When we boarded I had to haul our (very heavy) carryon bags up the steep staircase to the 747's upper deck (which we'd chosen in the hopes of a quieter and more-sleepful trip).Once onboard the service was excellent. The lie-flat beds were as promised
393046903;Lufthansa;5;15.07.16;Jul 16;0;Europe;Economy;Vilnius;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;;;5;This plane was as neat and tidy as a pin. Everything was so clean including the windows. The flight packets (magazine, plane information, Duty Free magazine, etc.) were all packaged in a plastic case, and inserted and aligned perfectly in the pocket in front of you. The flight attendants uniforms did not have a crease or wrinkle. They were very pleasant, and spoke very good English. We had a choice of drink, plus a marble like piece of coffee cake, which really was quite good.What really stood out for us was the boarding process. The flight was full, with not one empty seat, yet everybody boarded in such an orderly manner and so quickly and quietly that we were amazed. We are used to seeing all sorts of issues (no room for carry ons, cannot lift the carry on, slamming of overhead bin doors, not moving out of the aisle promptly, getting hit by backpacks as they pass by, etc.). None of this occurred here. The plane took off on time and arrived in Frankfurt on time. We enjoyed this flight.

Put up the hand-rests and voila- I created my own business class sleeper!The entertainment system was pretty good and they had a good collection of latest ones ( Including a few which had released in India).

The fleet out of India is pretty new (A380 if you are flying to Frankfurt). What adds to Lufthansa's appeal as an airline is also the airports in Germany that you would be flying through if you are going elsewhere in Europe or Americas. Germany airports are very well-managed in general. And efficient. I have never lost luggage flying through Germany.
391771908;Lufthansa;5;12.07.16;Apr 16;3;International;Business Class;Newark;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;4;5;5;We flew on the Lufthansa Flagship 747-8 and for the first time upstairs. It was great, on an overnight flight the Upper Deck is much more quiet. The Service was very good and the Personnel friendly. There is plenty of space to stow your Carry-on, either overhead or next to the Window seat. No lines to at the Restroom and no constant traffic in the aisle. The Flight was smooth and even while people complain that EWR is not punctual, we were in FRA a bit early. Full disclosure that we fly Lufthansa most of the time to Europe.

After waiting for checking in 20-25 minutes, I was waiting 10 minutes at the LH desk and than it took more that 30 minutes to pay! I gave my credit card and the girl called someone and by phone dictated my name, ticket nr, destination, beag weight, credit card number, etc .... I can not believe that this is the new level of Lufthansa services! I am a frequent flyer but prefer to loose my points and will choose other airlines!Services of Cheap Airlines like Wizzair and Ryannair ar even better but much cheaper!
391300065;Lufthansa;3;11.07.16;Jul 16;0;International;Economy;Abuja;Frankfurt;4;1;4;3;4;2;1;I cannot speak highly enough of the flight crew on Lufthansa. I regularly travel this route and have tried both Air France and BA. Lufthansa wins hands down. They have never lost my luggage, they have never been late and most importantly for me, their flight crew are highly professional and pleasant. The airlines are all modern and spotless. Unfortunately they are let down badly by their ground crew at Abuja airport who are disinterested and apathetic. Customer service as a concept is unknown to them. No effort is made to go the extra mile. This is a real shame as under the previous station manager, Lufthansa provided a great service at the airport. My experience was so poor that if it wasn't for the fight crew and the service at Frankfurt, I would be tempted to never fly with them again. As someone who flew on Lufthansa 22 times since last September, that is saying something ! If Lufthansa see this message, please sort out your ground team at Abuja international ! I would recommend Lufthansa anytime and for any destination, EXCEPT for Abuja !
390693919;Lufthansa;2;09.07.16;Jul 16;0;International;Economy;Tel-aviv;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;The flight did not have designated seats for families with babies and although this is happens sometimes, other airlines can often give families seats to suit the need, i.e a raw of 2 seats to make it easier for example. I could not breast feed easily, the baby slept in an awkward position and the person seating next to the window in our raw could not get out and was left with her food tray for the whole flight!

Oh and in Germany they have auto check in for your bags and auto scan passports for boarding the planes, ultra effecient.

The comfort and service was no better than a regular economy class of f.ex. Qatar or Emirates and on the shorter flights FRA-OSL/STO-FRA quite ridiculous to call Business class. I flew onwards with Icelandair to Keflavik (only 1 hour difference to LH short leg) but a class difference to all the LH flights. Will do my utmost to avoid Lufthansa in the future.

This was the first time we had flown the new LH lie flat seat which is light years ahead of there sloped version. We slept well after having an ok meal. I have never had such an overcooked filet of beef in my life which was interesting as my filet in AC's pY was probably the best airborne steak I have ever had. LH should have a word with their caterer in Vancouver. The service from the 2 ladies on the upper deck of the 744 was outstanding. nothing was too much bother - an area that I find LH to be consistently good. Breakfast was ok and before we knew it we were descending into FRA. Another great flight on LH - one that we were grateful for the offer to upgrade. PY on the way home!

On none of my flights, the airline has disappointed me, and the contrast to others (in my case, the frequent alternative is SAS), Lufthansa is the clear winner. The crew is fabulous: from the very welcome, there are smiles, good-humoured remarks, competence and effectiveness. Eloquent, often funny announcements from the cockpit: easy going tone, yet respectful and informative.The personnel has an impeccable look and attitude - things are just ""in order"". The service is perfect, and even in Economy, there are still free drinks (the amazing variety includes white & red wine, even German ""Sekt""!) and tasty snacks of high quality (the sandwiches are an enjoyable experience!).Whenever there are changes, the information and compensation is appreciable.Only negative: the recent changes in policy (categories, seat reservation, luggage restrictions) that follow other airlines' practises.

Add to that limited entertainment options, and you don't have a great long haul flight. Excess baggage rate was USD150, instead of the $100 expected. Not sure what a 'world class' airline was thinking when they decided to charge for seat reservations. Having just flown with Emirates a few days prior, which has screens as large as a laptop, plenty of movie & entertainment choices and 2pc baggage allowance for US flights and 30KG on other flights, will only travel LH when necessary. Gulf carriers have better service and value for money.

I haven't flown Lufthansa for a while now overseas and I was very disappointed with their in flight service and quality of meals. On board it's almost as 'why are you here?' One of the most unfriendly and uncaring services I have ever experienced. Food quality and quantity also was really mediocre.I was really surprised to see how quickly Lufthansa has deteriorated over the past year.In the other hand, the seat was perfect. Sleeping was very comfortable on board this 388.Another annoying aspect was the connection in Frankfurt. No one to welcome first class passengers, no limousine service to the lounge. You have to walk in that crazy airport for miles before you get to the lounge plus go through another security check which doesn't exist in most other airports if you are coming from the USA.For the price paid, I would certainly chose another European airlines before flying Lufthansa again and avoid Frankfurt Airport for any kind of connection.

They didn't have enough food for everyone, and they said that they didn't have enough time to arrange the foods. That was very weird answer. I got a sandwich, yee. At Malta's terminal, LHT didn't even have a priority lane for business passengers at the gate. And usually the toilet in the cabin near the business class is for the business class personnel, but on the flight the cabin personnel let all the passengers use the business class toilet.Please remember to install the Lufthansa entertainment Apps before the flight. On the flight there is free wifi, but if you do not have the apps preinstalled on your mobile device before departure, then you cannot use the music, movies, etc. on the flight.
383671732;Lufthansa;2;18.06.16;Jun 16;0;Europe;Economy;Rome;Frankfurt;3;2;4;4;2;2;1;Summary: if you're flying between the Americas and Asia/Middle East/Africa, avoid Lufthansa at all costs. Go for an Arab airline where you'll get a far superior product, service, and transfer facilities for a lower cost. If you're flying to Europe or within Europe, go for a low cost carrier. You'll get the same poor service for a lower cost.Thank you Lufthansa, for reminding me why I stopped flying with you years ago. To start, the flight was delayed without explanation for an hour. Then the pilot said we were waiting for a group who just changed tickets to make it onto an our flight. That's great for them, but what about everyone already on board who had connecting flights?Service was abysmal, but that should be expected from flight within Europe. Frankfurt airport was also one of the worst terminals I have ever seen. Once you enter Concourse C, there is literally not one eating establishment or shop that sells basic items. I've been in airports in the middle of rural Southeast Asia with far superior facilities. It felt like a large prison, and there were no way to exit the concourse without going back through passport control. This left almost everyone on our second flight desperate for any sort of food.
383622155;Lufthansa;4;18.06.16;Jun 16;0;Europe;Economy;London;Frankfurt;3;4;4;4;;4;4;Took Lufthansa from LDN to FRA on 9 Jun. Plane and toilet are clean. Ground staff at the check-in counter were friendly. Only a more elderly male service staff on that flight was a bit hostile in his behaviour. He refused to make eye contact and when I asked him to clear the cups and napkins, he refused to do it and said they would be doing it shortly. Bearing in mind that he had nothing in his hand at that moment. When I tried to ask him for more water, he simply refused to make eye contact and pretend he never hear anything. No smile from him either but he was very friendly with the other European passengers on board. In my opinion, anyone in the service line should provide good service not based on color of the skin of your customers. The other 3 service crew consisting of one young chap and 2 other ladies were very helpful and friendly. My son and me were very thirsty so when I asked for additional cups of water from the young chap he was very prompt. Overall a nice flight experience.
383484254;Lufthansa;1;17.06.16;May 16;1;International;Economy;Los Angeles;Frankfurt;2;1;2;2;3;3;2;I must say that this was by far the WORST in flight service I have ever experienced in my 43 years of flying. Its sad to see an airline like Lufthansa deteriorate so dramatically over the years. Rude and unhelpful airline hostesses who seem to be there by force not by will, don't help with a positive perception of the airline, especially on longer flights. Maybe Lufthansa needs to learn about service from Emirates or Virgin. BTW they took my exit row seat to give me an entire row to myself in the back, however the so called empty row had a large gentleman and a mother with her 1 yr old daughter (whom the gentleman and myself had to assist throughout the flight because the crew were not ever around).
382779100;Lufthansa;3;15.06.16;Jun 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Miami;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;I fly Lufthansa quite often from Israel to the United States (and back). I was pleasantl surprised when they accepted my (very low) offer to upgrade to premium economy class for my flight from Miami to Frankfurt. There was one error though. They lost my special kosher meal reservation when they upgraded me. I was on a flight for over 9 hours with no meals. I showed the head purder my itinerary which indicated the special meal, but at 35,000 feet, there was nothing he could do. There were no other kosher meals on board. He was nice and offered me a 25 EURO voucher to use in the shops in Germany before my next connection. On board, they were great. However, when I returned to Israel, I contacted Lufthansa via email as well as via phone and they didn't want to hear my complaint. hey never even responded to my (2) emails. I find this to be unacceptable at best and highly discouraging regarding future flights.
382742735;Lufthansa;5;15.06.16;Jun 16;0;International;First Class;New York;Frankfurt;5;5;5;5;4;5;5;We flew from NYC to Frankfurt on our way to Malta. We opted for 1st class and were treated royally. The seats on this A380 were incredible. Fully reclined. Flight attendants will make up the bed when requested. Duvet and really good blanket and pillows. The attends came out and introduced themselves and then came and thanked us at the end of the flight. The lounge in NY and in Frankfurt was excellent. And the car service directly to the airplane was an incredible experience. Almost like having your own plane. The food was as good as I've ever had on any flight. Caviar, lobster, terrific wines. It will tough to go back regular business travel after this experience!
382629172;Lufthansa;1;14.06.16;Jun 16;0;International;Business Class;Tel-aviv;Frankfurt;1;1;2;2;1;1;2;I bought 2 roundtrip business class tickets for travel between Chicago and Tel-aviv with all legs of trip to be business class but Lufthansa provided only economy class seating for the leg of the trip it flew, a 4 1/2 hour connecting flight from Tel-aviv to Frankfurt. To amplify, the cabin wall said business class but the seating was exactly the same as the economy class cabin -- same narrow seats, same small leg room, same 3 seats on each side of the aisle configuration. The only differences from economy were Lufthansa served a decent meal with warm washcloths, left the middle seats vacant, and provided free checked luggage. I had bought business class to ensure my elderly mother (86 years old) with a bone cancer that causes bone pain would be comfortable during this long journey. She was very uncomfortable during this flight. She tried to lay across several seats but the hard seat edges hurt her. When I objected upon boarding and seeing the lack of true business class seating, the head flight attendant told me that all Lufthansa flights within Europe have a business class configured exactly like economy class. I can't imagine why anyone would pay $600 more per seat for the meal service and free checked luggage. Lufthansa certainly does not provide a business class for in-Europe flights that meets the usual standard Americans expect, that is, at a minimum, wide seats, 2 seats on each side of the aisle, and gracious leg room (in addition to meal service and free checked luggage). I was so unhappy seeing my mother look so uncomfortable and disappointed after paying almost $7,000 for our roundtrip tickets. It was very unfair and I would never trust Lufthansa again. By the way, the chief flight attendant, the most senior person on board who was dispatched to discuss my complaint, was very unhelpful. She claimed she could not provide me with a corporate address to which I could submit a request for partial refund.

OK, the new LH C class has a few constraints (e.g., modified table [compared to 'old' C class] => makes leaving your seat after service has commenced more difficult than in the past), but overall this is an improvement. Never mind that feet may touch in the new V-shaped C-class seating

Upon landing at Frankfurt, sat on the tarmac for approximately 30 mins waiting for a bus to come fetch us. We were advised there had been a power outage at Frankfurt airport and therefore they couldn't dispatch a bus immediately. Eventually a bus arrived and then took us on loops around the airport, three times to be exact. Kept going back to a gate but nothing was happening so took us round again. This lasted for 45 mins with no explanation as to what was happening. Finally got released into the airport. Poor / non -existent communication throughout the process. Ended up being over 2 hours late for a meeting.

379216321;Lufthansa;2;02.06.16;May 16;1;International;Business Class;Seattle;Frankfurt;2;;4;1;;2;2;"My wife and I flew on Lufthansa flight 491 on May 24 from SEA to FRA in business on the upper deck of a 747-400. Overall, this was a disappointing experience, and definitely the worst we've ever had in a Lufthansa premium cabin. It seems as though Lufthansa has gone down hill in recent years. We will no longer seek them out for transatlantic flights. Lounge: the contract lounge LH uses at SEA is pretty bad. Crowded and lacking in any amenities or food. The United lounge was also closed for the day (remodeling?). Luckily our Amex cards gave us access to the very good Centurion Studio at SEA. Boarding: pretty awful. Everyone crowding the gate at least 15 min before departure. Boarding started later than noted on boarding cards. Kind of hectic with very long lines (even for biz). Seat: this was our first experience in the new LH business class seat. Honestly, Lufthansa really screwed up with this seat. It's not well designed, lacking in comfort, controls are not intuitive and poorly located, completing lacking in privacy, and suffering from LH's horrible decision to not give every seat aisle access, which results in either (a) aisle passengers being disturbed by window passengers climbing over them to get to the bathroom, or (b) window passengers having to jump over sleeping aisle passengers. My wife is six months pregnant, and she found the seat to be completely uncomfortable (whereas she was pretty comfortable in the Virgin Atlantic business seat on our return). The dividers between the rows are very low, which means very little privacy if your seat is in sleeping position - as an example, a passenger behind me turned on her reading light attached to her headrest during the flight, which literally lit up the bulkhead a row in front of us. Finally, the cabin was uncomfortably hot for the entire flight, and there are no individual air vents for these seats. This seat is only marginally better than the crap that United currently sells as BusinessFirst on their 747s and some 777s, which isn't saying much. It's probably the worst business class seat of any European airline. Lufthansa should be ashamed that even Alitalia has a better seat. Food: seriously, the worst food we've ever had in a premium cabin. We don't get that caught up on airline food, but this was truly bad. Hopefully this is more of a SEA problem than a global LH problem. Flight Attendants: efficient and courteous, which is what to be expected from Lufthansa. Arrival in FRA: horrible. Parked at remote gate and had to be bussed in. How is this acceptable for a 747?! Our connecting flight to the UK was also at a remote gate, but it was only an A320. It's not acceptable for large wide-body planes at major hubs like FRA to use remote gates. The ""efficient"" agents on the ramp at arrival made the entire bus cram together until there was not an ounce of breathing room before they allowed the buses to depart for the terminal. Definitely not a pleasant experience for my pregnant wife or any of the elderly and mobilly-challenged passengers on the plane. Overall, this was not a pleasant experience."
379083965;Lufthansa;2;02.06.16;May 16;1;International;Economy;San Francisco;Frankfurt;4;1;4;5;5;3;4;Flying this company is always a pleasure. But the customer service of Lufthansa in Frankfurt airport is terrible. Imagine the situation when all flights were canceled and the whole airport was closed for three hours because of weather condition. All people were sent simultaneously to the customer service with only five representatives to re-book their flights. There was a huge line of people (no less than a thousand) desperate to get out of Frankfurt and only five helpless and frustrated customer service representatives. There were also several computerized stations where you supposedly could re-book your flight automatically. But it didn't work for most people because of buggy software Lufthansa uses for this automatic process. Add to all this things total absence of information to give people an update on their new flights status. So, all in all it was a total chaos.I don't know how Lufthansa customer service works in other airports but they definitely must do something to prepare themselves better for resolving such situations in proper manner in Frankfurt airport.

What an incredible experience and TREAT! Lufthansa makes me believe that flying can actually be the pleasurable experience that it used to be a gazillion years ago. The seats are comfortable and I was even seated in the middle of a three-across which I was dreading. The service was lovely and the food was even good...can it be possible?! I know that the attendants must have thought that I was some slightly deranged person because, as I was deplaning, I thanked each and every one of them and told them how ""wonderful"" the flight had been. The return flight from Munich to Denver (10+ hrs) was equally fine even though we had a ground delay and missed our connecting flight. Bravo and Kudos to Lufthansa!

I take original flight anyway and race through airport to find gate closed even though still 15 minutes to flight. Apparently as bus transfer required and plane was ""too far away"" so they had to go. No second bus or even small transfer car for two of us who'd raced to get there, even though lufthansa knew we were there, on our way, and it was their fault To add insult to injury, the ultimate alternative I took which inclined two flights with air France instead, did run a second bus for three late passengers who got on with little over five minutes to take off. Having suffered a near 90 minute delay on the outward journey on the very first flight of the day from aberdeen, which again involved rebooking due to missed connections, I can only say my first lufthansa flights will also be my last.

377338915;Lufthansa;2;28.05.16;May 16;0;International;Business Class;Delhi;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;We travelled thinking we would be really cared for. But it did not happen. We were travelling Business class from Delhi to Washington. On the transit flight from Delhi to Frankfurt on 17th May, I left my laptop by mistake in the side compartment below the window. Just as we got out of the plane, we realized that we had left it inside. But, the staff did not allow us to go back into the aircraft. I do not understand the reason for such behaviour. Even the Lufthansa representative was not ready to get it for us outside. The Lufthansa business lounge people also did not help. The lounge people just said that I should report it on lost-found website. I did that, I sent them detailed descriptions, and pictures of the laptop and bag, as well as our seat location, flight details, timings, everything. But, till date it is reported not found. If it could not be retrieved immediately, and it could not even be found after giving so many details, then do I assume that it just disappeared? It is not possible that it is lost. It has to exist with either the cleaning staff or the airline. It really shows the unhelpful attitude of the airline, to dismiss such an important thing of the passenger just like that. Laptops are not mere computers these days. They hold data of the whole lives of people. I am totally dis-satisfied by the we-don‰Ûªt-care-it's-your-fault attitude of the airline. I'm sure that travelling Business class should have some advantages of better service by the airlines. Such behaviour is not expected even with Economy Class passengers, leave aside Business Class. Especially, the main thing is that it could have immediately been recovered and my important personal possession could have been saved. Do you really think I would love to travel by this airline again? I feel so lost without it ‰ÛÒ feel bad that no one from the airline came to my help. I have always travelled with Lufthansa. But now I feel let down ! I still have not lost hope and am following up every day, thinking maybe some good soul would locate it and give it back to me.

The flight was very pleasant and no turbulence felt (thanks to the giant aircraft and the good weather). The only shortage was we did not get much information after arrived at Frankfurt, about our canceled connecting flight due to pilot strike. Perhaps it was too emergency, we also had bad experience to get our canceled flight resumed, and we've basically wasted our hotels, and precious time. Nevertheless, they did reimburse us free meals, free transport to and fro hotel, and free stay at Frankfurt before our next flight on next morning which i guess fair enough.

Lufthansa still serves sandwiches on their short flights (under 2 hours) which is quite strange to see but hey! we enjoyed that. I find them very good with small children, it has always been my experience. If I have a choice I book Lufthansa over Air Canada.
373792050;Lufthansa;5;17.05.16;Apr 16;1;International;Economy;Rio de Janeiro;Frankfurt;3;5;;;5;;;After a terrible experience with IBERIA including an emergency landing (with firemen and a two day stay in a hotel) we were re-routed. After such experience, to fly with Lufthansa was a balsam. The flight attendances were great, the plane comfortable. And after knowing about the situation we had experienced they were caring all the flight to make us feel safe.
373681767;Lufthansa;4;17.05.16;Feb 16;3;International;Business Class;Philadelphia;Frankfurt;3;4;;;3;2;;For 17 years now I travel regularly with Lufthansa and I belong to the Senator Card holders...if this stilll means anything...I appreciate Lufthansa, they have a solid product, reliable planes and organization, the crews are well trained and do follow the protocol by the numbers.Now in the last 17 years I have seen service going down, valuable customers not valued anymore, food boring, drinks...same and their international business class is just not up to the standards with a 2-2-2 configuration, no full access...I would like to carry on flying with LH and I appreciate the strong head wind they face with Emirates, Qatar, Etihad...companies having different costs models to say the least but business travels is not charity ...it will be hard to carry on justifying flying with them in the future unless a huge improvement is implemented

372488208;Lufthansa;4;12.05.16;May 16;0;International;Economy;Delhi;Frankfurt;2;2;;;3;3;;I have traveled many times with Lufthansa ,but writing a review first time ,I noticed that they do not serve good whiskey to Economy class travelers and they even dont bother if you have given the choice for Jain food but other things are good not best
372455377;Lufthansa;5;12.05.16;May 16;0;International;First Class;Tokyo;Frankfurt;5;5;;;5;4;;"Flying in first class on any airline is a treat, but the impeccable service of Lufthansa makes it one of the world's best. There (relatively) new First Class cabin is incredible, and on newer aircraft like the 747-8i, it's like heaven in the clouds.The flight attendants are there for any need or whim, and are only too happy to assist in any reasonable request. The seat is incredibly comfy, and be sure to have them put the mattress pad and give you a duvet for a cozy night of sleep. Love the personal ""locker"" instead of having to deal with an overhead compartment.The food & wine are superb, though LH does need to work on their amuse bouche. I think I have yet to have one on this airline that I find edible.Only other complaint would be that the TV size does seem be smaller than some of their rivals."

370850057;Lufthansa;4;07.05.16;May 16;0;International;Economy;Bangalore;Frankfurt;4;5;;;4;4;;Lufthansa has very good service and is much better than U.S. airline service. I had a problem with my entertainment system and the steward immediately got a flashlight to check it out, then reset my system to fix the problem. The stewards and stewardesses are very polite and helpful. The legroom and food quality also seem better than the U.S. airlines' offerings.
370411478;Lufthansa;3;05.05.16;Dec 15;5;International;Economy;Toronto;Frankfurt;3;3;;;3;3;;I am sorry I don't have anything to gush about on this airline, unlike the other reviewers.While reviewing other airlines, I was prompted to review 'any other airlines' by tripadvisor.My experience with this airline has been average. The crew on the flight was friendly, service (delivery of service without demand or request) was average. Food was however better than most other North American airlines (cough cough AC)The airline should have a better policy on seat allocation?I was seated next to a mother with a crying infant.Probably not the airline's fault though.
370401738;Lufthansa;4;05.05.16;Apr 16;1;Europe;Economy;Barcelona;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;No frills for this short trip. A beer and a dry tasteless sandwich, no movies or entertainment. I was traveling 3 connecting flights to Vancouver, but my bag only got checked as far as Toronto. That meant a huge hassle at the Toronto airport, where I had to go through customs twice to recheck my bag through to Vancouver. Also refused to print all my boarding passes, so I had to do this at each airport.
369814359;Lufthansa;1;03.05.16;Apr 16;1;Europe;Premium Economy;Manchester;Frankfurt;2;1;;;1;1;;The title sums it up really, my own fault I guess as you get what you pay for.I generally travel with BA but I had left it too late to book this trip.Last time I couldn't get a seat on a BA flight I chanced it with Jet2 and it had been ok, cheap and cheerful but ok so assumed I would be ok with Lufthansa too. How wrong can you be?.Customer service was very much lacking verging on plain rude during embarkation, food was totally unacceptable and choice almost none existent. Entertainment was very poor (fortunately I always bring a good book on flights anyway). I felt the entire experience was very poor in comparrison to even Jet2 who were actually quite good. I would never use this airline again and have also found out today that they are the only airline who have agreed to transport dogs to China to supply the gambeling and meat trade. This disgusts me even more than my own experience of flying with them,but perhaps the dogs will be able to eat their aircraft meals. Never again.
369709322;Lufthansa;5;02.05.16;Aug 15;9;International;Economy;Chicago;Frankfurt;;;;;;;;Despite complicated changes in my reservation and many calls the people assisting me were very patient. German quality really apply to Lufthansa customer service. Plus, they did not charged me for anything. I am very satisfied how my case was handled. Flying with Lufthansa also was a great experience. The only bad thing in the past was a employee walking with hand scale and checking the carry on baggage weight at the waiting area in Chicago couple years ago. Otherwise I recommend Lufthansa.
369534882;Lufthansa;5;02.05.16;Apr 16;1;International;Business Class;Rio de Janeiro;Frankfurt;5;5;;;3;5;;The Rio - Frankfurt direct flight (501/500) seems to me to be the best Rio-Europe option at the moment. The aircracft, a renovated 747, is very nice and the business class canin and seats are the best configuration I've seen so far. A very comfortable and convenient flight.
368225700;Lufthansa;5;27.04.16;Apr 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Houston;Frankfurt;5;5;;;4;4;;The leg room, as well as the width of the seat was generous & comfortable. There was a TV screen on the back of each seat & a good choice of movies & TV. My husband & I enjoyed the latest Star Wars movie. The meals were ok, more edible than most airline food: salad, cheese, entree, & a pretty good desert. The attendants were generous with the wine, which helped to make the time more pleasant. Flight was on time.
368028056;Lufthansa;4;26.04.16;Oct 15;6;International;Business Class;Seattle;Frankfurt;2;4;;;4;3;;Lufthansa still provide decent service in Business Class, though like most airlines they've increased the cabin size and reduced the quality of the service. Business is still good, but it feels less personal, less comfortable. The seats seem to be the hardest in the business, leaving me anxious to get up and move around or just get off the plane after a nine hour flight.The two biggest complaints I have about Lufthansa are their main hub in Frankfurt, which is possibly the worst-laid out terminal complex in Europe, and their business class lounges which are uninspired and underwhelming. A big YAWN there.
368007437;Lufthansa;5;26.04.16;Apr 16;0;International;Business Class;San Francisco;Frankfurt;5;5;;;3;4;;Love flying Lufthansa. Clean and nicely designed planes. The flat beds in business class are very comfortable. Consistently excellent and diverse food. Always love the warm choices of bread. Flight attendants are professional.

367347275;Lufthansa;2;25.04.16;Apr 16;0;International;Economy;Tehran;Frankfurt;3;3;;;3;2;;We had a very bad experience with this air line, first of all we paid for bassinet sits and on the day of the trip they changed our seats without notifying us, after the plane started moving and ready for take off captain had an announcement with engin issue, they kept us in the aircraft for more than 4 hours and then they asked us to go back to the gate, they promised to send us to hotel and when get out they said you can go to hotel yourself and claim it later. they promised the plan will be fixed soon and we can go ahead and that never happend and every body had to go with other air lines. what was bothering us was mismanaging the situation and wasting people's time with wrong directions.
367289745;Lufthansa;4;25.04.16;Apr 16;0;International;Business Class;Caracas;Frankfurt;3;4;;;4;2;;have been using this airline for the last 20 years, really used to love it. I will rarely use it again, because they did 2 years ago changes in their frequent flyer program. You can get a lot of airlines which offer a good service, but if you are looking for a program that rewards you loyalty (I travel at least 10 times per year between Europe and South America) you should look somewhere else. When you have a Senator Status it is literally almost imposible to renew it when not flying the most expensive travel clases like Y , C of A/F
366608482;Lufthansa;5;23.04.16;May 15;11;International;Business Class;Calgary;Frankfurt;5;5;;;5;4;;Lufthansa is my preferred airline to fly to Europe. The airline is very efficient, the service is very attentive and helpful, there is a good selection of wines and the food is truly first class. I got help with my computer plug in on my last flight - very helpful as I forgot my adapter. I wish we could get more of this class of service in the United States.
365870666;Lufthansa;1;20.04.16;Apr 16;0;International;Economy;Mumbai;Frankfurt;2;1;;;2;1;;Bad airline about the luggage they weigh all bags carry on too.he was 2 kg over but I have low weight in my checking bags so they let me my checking bags and charged me $ 200 for carry on.so I paid $ 300 for two extra bags I am very unhappy and I will my family and friends to don't fly Lufthansa Airline and never my life fly in Lufthansa aircraft
365525979;Lufthansa;2;19.04.16;Apr 16;0;International;Economy;Vancouver;Frankfurt;2;4;;;4;3;;We had heard great things about Lufthansa and had high expectations of them as a world class airline. As soon as we took our seats we noticed the TV screens were very close! Immediately the seats felt cramped. When the passenger in front reclined their seat, the TV was practically in my lap. I've flown with many different airlines and this is the most cramped I can recall ever feeling on any flight. The flight was less than 10 hours and I was uncomfortable for the most part - more so than even on a recent 15 hour flight to Australia. The staff were polite and helpful. The food was below par.Overall, based on the discomfort of the seat, I wouldn't book with them again.
365506728;Lufthansa;4;19.04.16;May 15;11;International;Economy;Toronto;Frankfurt;3;5;;;4;4;;Lufthansa is a reliable, always on time, trustworthy airline .Always good entertainment to keep you occupied .Decent food and drinks .

365238843;Lufthansa;5;18.04.16;Apr 16;0;International;Business Class;Dubai;Frankfurt;4;5;;;4;4;;I am always surprised by the hospitality of the cabin crew of LH. They do a wonderful job on serving everyone. Smiling, which is the most important treat for a business passenger.I don't eat for the majority of the time on the planes, however, they always make me feel that I am missing on their home cooked meals. They provide an outstanding service and care to my needs.
364880441;Lufthansa;2;17.04.16;Mar 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Hong Kong;Frankfurt;3;3;;;3;3;;Took Lufthansa instead of Cathay Pacific due to price ( big difference ) and the plane is in very good condition but food was tasteless on both to and back from Frankfurt. I travel twice a month and was real shocked by quality of food served on board! The mainland Chinese next to me took one mouthful of his 'Chinese' style breakfast and gave up....
364334100;Lufthansa;5;15.04.16;Mar 16;1;International;Economy;Newark;Frankfurt;3;5;;;5;5;;Excellent Airline this was our first Flight with Lufthansa and we had a great flight first class service, this is service i remember from several years ago, Hot Towels, water prior to take off, Drinks before your meal plus drinks during your meal, also continued drinks a snacks during the flight, could not fault the food, excellent.
364142230;Lufthansa;4;14.04.16;Mar 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Tokyo;Frankfurt;4;5;;;3;4;;The seat width is rather small compared to Premium economy seats in other airlines, but it has enough pitch. It reclines pretty well which means if a passenger in front of you slides the seat, it is a little bothersome. The highlight was the food. They were all tasty and well balanced. I was impressed that coffee was served normal, not burnt like other airlines. Only one suggestion. They should make the blanket warmer.
363705438;Lufthansa;4;12.04.16;Apr 16;0;Europe;Economy;Porto;Frankfurt;3;4;;;;4;;Due to a strike with the french air traffic controllers, we had to flight the day after, because our flight was canceled. The captain himself went to the boarding gate to announced the cancellation and the reason why. The A321 was clean and the crew was friendy and professional. We bought business class tickets, but due to the cancelation we had to fly in economy. Normally I don't ate the snack they offered, but since I was starving i tasted the salmon sandwich. Not bad. Departure on time and arrival on schedule.
363414126;Lufthansa;5;11.04.16;May 15;11;Europe;Premium Economy;London;Frankfurt;4;5;;;5;4;;Perfect service compared to any other airline I have flown with. Very helpful & professional staff. In flight catering very welcoming. Snacks & drinks every now & then.
363045586;Lufthansa;5;10.04.16;Mar 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Toronto;Frankfurt;4;5;;;4;4;;This was our flight trans Atlantic flight and we were looking forward to our trip to India.Because of the total length of time to reach India we chose to upgrade to Premium Economy.Much to our surprise on the first leg which was to Frankfurt we were upgraded free of charge to Business Class. Everything was perfect from the food to the overall service to the fully reclining seat for sleeping.The next leg was from Frankfurt to Mumbai India and we flew this leg Premium Economy. The price paid was well worth it. We had more leg room, wider seats which reclined further and very attentive cabin staff. The food was very good as was the in cabin entertainment.We highly recommend this airline and will certainly travel with them again.
362505267;Lufthansa;5;08.04.16;Mar 16;1;International;Business Class;Mexico City;Frankfurt;5;4;;;5;4;;From Mexico to Europe, flights am, pm, reaching Munich or Frankfurt, is the best getaway between America and Europe. Do not expect to find the best prices, but yes the best airports experience in Germany, new airplanes, be real the Jumbo is the perfect carrier, seats are more than confortable, service has been improving since 10 years now, and having the option to always fly at night is a great value for your health, your money and to the constant traveller or occasional traveler. Food is great.
361479102;Lufthansa;4;04.04.16;Mar 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Hong Kong;Frankfurt;4;4;;;3;4;;good service and the meal is above average. First with a welcome drink and then served the dinner before sleep. The seat is spacey and can sleep well. Worth a try to bid for upgrade via Lufthansa website with a cheaper price.
361399213;Lufthansa;1;04.04.16;Mar 16;1;International;Economy;Singapore;Frankfurt;1;3;;;1;1;;My wife and I flew on LH778 and LH 779 on 24.2.16 and 25.3.16 respectively (booking ref 4O2RRG). We paid a total of å£280 for 2 seat reservations with extra leg room. We occupied seats 75B and 75C on the outward and inward flights. These seats were by the 4 toilets and we were constantly prevented from sleeping by the continual slamming of the toilet doors and the bright lights as the toilet doors opened after use. Then there is the unpleasant odour of being in such close proximity to the lavatories.It has been a terrible experience and ruined the start and end of the holiday. Both my wife and I had our toes stood on or legs kicked as people queued in the semi-dark for the toilets throughout the night flights. I do not expect to pay å£280 for this type of experience. Furthermore passengers, understandably, were regularly using the space to stretch their limbs, stand up or simply look out of the door window. It was busier than a airport lounge and is not pleasant as one tries to simply relax or eat the airline meal. I complained to the crew and although they were helpful they could not possibly resolve the situation although incredibly we were offered standard seats as an alternative but not a refund. We effectively lost two nights sleep and we lost the first day of our holiday in Singapore as we were in no condition or the right frame of mind to leave our hotel room. Equally our experience on the return journey ensured we were suitably downtrodden. The toilets, in their central position, were serving around 266 people and few used the toilets at the very front or rear of the aeroplane. The seats we occupied, being where they are, means that to sell these seats as extra legroom is a diabolical disgrace. Every single member of the crew we spoke to (four in total) separately agreed with this point and it did not require any encouragement or prompting. If the crew know it then surely you are well aware of this too and yet you continue to sell these seats as being in a privileged position without any warning as to their unsuitability. Why is this? We both feel that we have been cheated and quite blatantly robbed by a reputable business as the seats are sold by you securely in the knowledge that they are actually inappropriate and the reality is that you may have extra legroom but you cant use it to any advantage. I believe and am very confident that this will not be the first complaint of this nature from dissatisfied customers using these seats. I cant think that we shall ever travel with the airline again, particularly in such seats. As I write this complaint I am naturally very, very angry. I may still be tired and irritable but the hurt comes from knowing that this extra å£280 we paid, for the holiday of a lifetime, has been quite readily taken off us by Lufthansa in such a deceitful manner.
361045969;Lufthansa;5;02.04.16;Mar 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Mexico City;Frankfurt;5;5;;;4;5;;Premiun Economy was a good experience, im tall and i had plenty leg room to rest during the 11 hour flight, the service excellent, 2 meals lots of veberages, the 747 800 i plane a good experience to have

359843672;Lufthansa;5;29.03.16;Feb 16;1;International;First Class;Mexico City;Frankfurt;5;5;;;4;5;;All that I expect from a five star Airline. Some People may say that other offers more Service but regarding Facts I have to honor LH. They are in time, on board Service is excellent, local ground stuff knows their Job, seats are excellent. For Business travellers they konw what they Need, Internet Access, electricity, beverages and Food that also indicates the local touch (i.e. german wines if this is a german Airline). I like to fly LH every time I am on Business trip as they provide exactly the Service I need
359452070;Lufthansa;5;28.03.16;Mar 16;0;Europe;Economy;Barcelona;Frankfurt;4;5;;;4;4;;This airline is first class. They treat you like luxury passengers even in coach. Morning service included drinks, hot towels and a lovely piece of orange cake. The flight attendants and pilots speak German first then translate into English. The announcements are so professional and calm sounding. They do not bark at you like other airlines (United) and their crew carry themselves professionally. Their hair is neat and attire nicely pressed. They are classy and friendly. The planes from Barcelona to Frankfurt then on to SFO were extremely clean. It was a wonderful experience.
358617887;Lufthansa;5;25.03.16;Mar 16;0;International;Business Class;Beijing;Frankfurt;5;5;;;5;4;;"The word I would use to describe the people and service would be ""respect"". Most airlines are friendly, but Lufthansa always makes me feel respected. In fact, when I travel I hang out in the Lufthansa lounges, regardless of the carrier I'm using.

On the way to the USA leaving with SAS we experience the worst service ever, old plane, no tv and we had to pay for drinks. With Lufthansa in economic we got everything, drinking, food and snacks. And a smile ... For free.The service was really great, and traveling with small kids, it's important. The new plane was also amazing. I will definitely travel with Lufthansa again.
357489029;Lufthansa;4;21.03.16;Feb 16;1;International;Economy;Chicago;Frankfurt;4;3;;;4;4;;The flight attendants were super nice and attentive to everyone's needs. Since the flight wasnt crowded at all they had more time and resources to do that. I do seem to notice that the flight attendant man (men) are generally way better than the girls who work there. The food was good, nothing too special, but delicious.
354828399;Lufthansa;5;12.03.16;Mar 16;0;International;Economy;Mumbai;Frankfurt;5;4;;;3;5;;I love to fly with Lufthansa to Germany from Mumbai. direct from Mumbai no stops. nice flight, overall food and ambient very good.
354798812;Lufthansa;4;12.03.16;Feb 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Washington;Frankfurt;4;5;;;5;5;;We tried Lufthansa's new Premium Economy and found it superior to such classes on US airlines (think Economy Plus on United). Not only do you get more legroom, but the seat is wider, the TV much bigger, and the service more enhanced with hot towels and a travel goody bag. I've not been a fan of Lufthansa in the past except for business and first class. It's nice to know they have this reasonably priced alternative to coach.
354413636;Lufthansa;4;10.03.16;Feb 16;1;Europe;Economy;Amsterdam;Frankfurt;3;4;;;5;3;;The check in staff were very pleasant and helpful and so were the staff on board the plane. Very clean plane and staff were lovely. Offered a light snack and beverage on board. The sandwich was fresh but contained lots of onion and mayonnaise, which was oozing out the sides of the bread. Had to deconstruct the sandwich in order to eat. (There was another else available, usually there is a choice between two e.g. chicken or ham). The beverage was just the usual filtered coffee, tea etc. We had a connecting flight from Frankfurt to Changi airport, Singapore. The longer flight was more difficult, less space available between seats and rows. Food was excellent, except for breakfast!! My entire family (four people) were sitting in the same row (middle of the plane). Breakfast was served, which was omelette with spinach and cheese. Breakfast looked hot, however on cutting into the omelette it was completely cold on the inside and still looked partially frozen. I notified flight staff and was given the option to heat my meal. I declined as the meal just looked unpleasant. Not safe food handling practice (I have worked in food handling as a business owner/operator) to have an egg based meal arrive partially heated and then attempted to reheat it.The rest of the flight was otherwise good. Spacing between seats and rows is always cramped and even more so when trying to sleep. This is always a drawback of flying Economy. Otherwise the flight was very pleasant. If I was to fly overseas again with this airline, I would save up for a business class or first class ticket in order to have a better experience and be able to sleep properly on the flight.

While this plane is a bit old, the accommodations were very comfortable and very spacious. The staff was very friendly, Professional and attentive but not overly so. The food was very good too. Could not ask for more. I would recommend the upper level and business class for everyone. But this would not be good for young children as any noise would be a problem for this small area. Keep children in the large cabin below - please.

353093111;Lufthansa;3;05.03.16;Dec 15;3;International;Economy;Delhi;Frankfurt;4;3;;;4;;;Though the domestic flights provided in Germany by Lufthansa have been pretty comfortable, the international experience wasn't nice. The organization, especially of allowing all the passengers in before take off and having the baggage kept took time and was pretty hectic. Though the flight itself was smooth but I did expect better from such a highly rated airline.

Seats comfortable but a little hard. They are a little narrow across the shoulders. Food was good as were wine lists. FA will give you a good suggestion of which wine would suit your meal should you choose. One thing I find with Lufthansa FA is that they all walk with very heavy feet and when you pay to,be able to sleep it is annoying. One thing which was very strange. Across the aisle from my partner was a German couple. As we approached landing the man stood up and took of his clothes to his underwear to,change and the his wife did the same! Not a good sight at all!
351137110;Lufthansa;2;26.02.16;Jan 16;1;International;Economy;Vancouver;Frankfurt;3;1;;;3;1;;One of my worst flying experiences ever! The cabin crew were obstinate and the food resembling road kill that was heated up in a washer. By the time we arrived in Frankfurt I was awash in plastic cups and other items that the cabin crew did not bother to collect.

Frankfurt Aerport is Huge and you need time to get connection but normally they have a good service and you can also enjoy a Lounge on the Aerport.

We found the seats of the A380 in business class uncomfortable, I was slipping and sliding around. However its still more comfortable than economy class. The food was ok, enjoyed the variety of the dessert available. I am surprized that there is so little ginger ale available on board. I dont know if it is a matter of language but sometimes it feels as if the hostesses are not very friendly.
350084332;Lufthansa;2;22.02.16;Apr 15;10;International;Economy;Singapore;Frankfurt;2;1;;;3;2;;Sour unhelpful flight attendants, who were not interested in trying to make my elderly Mother more comfortableFood was reasonable good but seats small and not alot of leg space for my brothers both of whom are over six foot tall - we had requested a seat near exits but once on board were told not available and we noticed two small teenage girls had been allocated these seats - why??
349977282;Lufthansa;2;22.02.16;Feb 16;0;International;Economy;Bangalore;Frankfurt;3;1;;;2;3;;"I had taken the flight from Bangalore to Frankfurt in economy class. The Check-in was smooth and I was offered an aisle seat. I had a good sleep and woke-up just in time for breakfast. During their breakfast Service, they offered a mini-masala dosa along with 3 button idlis along with fruits and bread. As I was very hungry, I requested for one more serving if possible. After a while, the air hostess came back with a packet of the same to be offered to me. When she gave me the packet, she said "" This time you got this, but next we may not be able to offer you"". It was such a rude response as I felt very low. In my view, there was no need for such a statement at all. Unless they take care of these aspects, there is no meaning in saying they offer ""Indian Hospitality""."
349855870;Lufthansa;5;21.02.16;Oct 15;4;International;Economy;Singapore;Frankfurt;4;5;;;4;4;;We flew in the A380, comfortable and spacious. Seats with enough leg room. The services from the Lufthansa crew was impressive. Nothing was a bother and provided us with drinks and snacks when requested. I loved the fact I was not made guilty by asking for a whisky and a beer right after the other! I will fly again with Lufthansa. We also did a few internal flights within europe using smaller aircrafts and we had the same experience
349701335;Lufthansa;3;21.02.16;Feb 16;0;Europe;Economy;St. Petersburg;Frankfurt;2;4;;;1;3;;St Petersburg airport is very comfortable, check-in was simple though the seats I had booked in the Lufthansa website disappeared and there was no interest in trying to address this. Passport control and security worked very well. The flight was on time. The plane was an older A-320, seats brutally uncomfortable, no power, no movies etc.. but the service went a long way to make up for this. A meal with wine on a 3 hour journey is a privilege us travelers in North America are no longer used to, service proficiently with a smile!

Staff was very friendly and nice but slow service.The food was ok in taste and tasty enough to feel the stomach without gastric disorder.Aircraft was clean and maintained, same goes for seat which were not to comfy not to hard. They offered Wifi with T-Mobile which was a bit expensive but is fast enough to complete urgent work and connect with friends While in Air.Baggage was nicely handled and quick. Check-In was poorly maintained.

Not only you get the quality of a flying bus, you are taken to the plane by a bus...The service onboard is also poor. Impatient flight attendants with rude responses to polite questions: "" no we cannot serve another drink now there are more than 60 passengers waiting to get theirs"" or ""no we won't come back with coffee we serve it now and there will be no change to have it later""....and more and more.Avoid it at any cost..."

She was extremely kind and generous and moved us into premium seating where we finished our very long flight from Orlando to Frankfurt. The return flight was hassle free and the staff on the flight was extremely friendly and kind. I will definitely fly Lufthansa again if given the opportunity.

I felt safe and the staff was unbelievably kind and helpful. I sat in a center inner row seat and it was a bit snug on the way there but we flew a larger plane on the way back and it was great.We were on time and, (early I think)! The amenities such as food, beverage and alcohol were stellar and the plane was clean. Very happy with our choice to fly with them and not another airline.

344847637;Lufthansa;4;03.02.16;Dec 15;2;International;Economy;Los Angeles;Frankfurt;4;4;;;5;3;;Lufthansa has been my #1 choice to go to Europe for many years. Part of it is that they have a non stop from LAX to FRA. Tidy airplanes, very professional service, and a very good on time record. Their maintenance is supposed to be bar none, but I wouldn't know.. Their equipment is amazing, A380, 747-800, etc. Wonderful airplanes. For those that care, they serve free liquor, and have decent meals as well. Usually, very clean rest rooms, and while their flight attendees aren't charming they get the job done in professional and German way.Expensive, but almost worth it.
344809079;Lufthansa;3;03.02.16;Jan 16;1;International;Economy;Johannesburg;Frankfurt;1;3;;;4;3;;Return flight from SA. Boeing 747, which was absolutely cramped with people as a major return flight from Cape Town to Germany the day before was cancelled and many passengers were transferred to this flight. Boarding was fast and efficient but that's where the positives end. We were crammed in the last row before the flight attendants' area. There was no leg room and the seat only partially reclined whereas the seat in front reclined fully. Seats were desperately uncomfortable. The food was less than average. Drinks were served throughout and at request. Entertainment selection was quite good but there was no flight info available at all which I found really poor as I like to know where I am and to plan ahead. Staff were friendly and efficient but you never felt that their heart was in it. What to me constitutes an absolute disgrace was the fact that there were only two toilets available at the front of our cabin and we were not given the option to use facilities in the other areas. Queue of 7 people in front of one cubicle - nightmare! I was drained and stressed out after the flight. LH offers the option of upgrading to premium economy with A LOT better seats and leg space - definitely worth it but rarely available. If you are planning on going economy - forget it. I'm afraid, but I'm going to use the Etihad/Emirates/Qatar alternative next time, particularly when you can't be sure that LH staff won't be on strike to keep their 1980s working/pension conditions. Wake up to the real world, LH people!
344698046;Lufthansa;4;03.02.16;Nov 15;3;International;Economy;Pune;Frankfurt;3;4;;;4;4;;Have used Lufthansa several times for official trips. Apart from one instance where the flight from Frankfurt to Pune for cancelled and I got to know only when I reached Helsinki airport for taking flight to Frankfurt for the same, I had nice experience overall with the airlines. In general the food quality and the service both had been good.
344051503;Lufthansa;5;31.01.16;Oct 15;3;International;Economy;Toronto;Frankfurt;4;5;;;3;4;;Organised boarding of the aircraft, both pleasant and helpful flight attendants, blanket and small pillow provided for the international flight, plenty to drink and food provided, clean cabin--one was made to feel comfortable and confident on board.

343690242;Lufthansa;3;29.01.16;Jan 16;0;International;Economy;Bangalore;Frankfurt;2;4;;;3;3;;747-800 flights ... somehow the seats are far more narrower in Lufthansa than in say Singapore Airlines (even though its the same aircraft with same seat configuration .. i.e., 3-4-3). The leg room is decent enough, but the narrowness of the seats have you squished right next to another passenger. Had a rather bulky passenger seated next to me and it was a 10 hour ordeal jostling for space. I love the seats on A380's ... wide enough even in economy class. They served a small snack item at start of flight and then when everyone was really hungry after almost 7 hours of nothing .. they served a half decent breakfast. All airlines are skimping on food these days. On my return flight, I ate a heavy lunch before boarding the flight and survived pretty good. Baggage handling was decent .. nothing broken for me. I have flow lufthansa several times over the last decade and they are usually on time. So I recommend them compared to other airlines ... though there is plenty of opportunity to improve and catch up with better airlines like Singapore, Emirates etc.

Whether they are economy or first class passengers, Lufthansa treats them all very well. There was a variety of food choices and they served it one row at a time, unlike many other airlines. Service was great and the crew were very polite and helpful.
342702367;Lufthansa;4;25.01.16;Apr 15;9;International;Premium Economy;Dallas;Frankfurt;4;5;;;5;5;;Lufthansa is probably my preferred airline: very professional service both on the ground and in flight. Very few delays and even when delays happen, they are prompt in re booking you on another flight. With Lufthansa, there are no major surprises (unless major strike occurs): you never get neither more or less from what you pay for - just as should be. Predictable and reliable

More than 4 days now#LUFTHANSA IS THE WORST AIRLINE in customer service and in baggage services. This is considered priority bag when you don't get your bags in your destination and no one even care to explain why you lost your bags.HORRIBLE AIRLINE AND DON'T EVEN THINK OF BOOKING ITOnly a kind guy his name is Devin in houston airport helped me with the claim to be able to track it but still no reply from them or even a compensation.Even they didn't apologise.
450946668;Lufthansa;2;10.01.17;Jan 17;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Singapore;2;3;;;1;1;;I have to admit upfront that I am not a fan of Lufthansa. Last time I flew them was 5.5 years ago. The service was so bad that I swore never to fly them again. Unfortunately my Turkish Airlines flights were canceled and I was re-routed on Lufthansa.The only thing that seems to have changed in the past 5 years is the aircraft. Unfortunately the rest is still the same. I flew business class on the A380. The seat configuration is the worst I've seen on any A380, very poor compared to competitors like Singapore Airlines or Emirates. Whilst it is a flat bed, the seat is narrow and short and even I (I'm only 1m78) need to curl up whilst sleeping. The in flight entertainment offer is very poor and significantly inferior to e.g. Emirates. The meal was mediocre, many airlines serve better food in economy class than what Lufthansa dares to serve in business class. There is wifi on-board, but you have to pay for using it, even in business class: ‰âÂ17 for the duration of the flight. On Turkish airlines, use of wifi is free in business class and the ticket is a lot cheaper on Turkish airlines. The ground staff in Frankfurt hasn't gotten any better either in the past 5 years. Didn't think it was possible, but they grew even less useful and more lazy and arrogant than before! At the gate they were too lazy to check whether our luggage had made the connection. The only positive points were the on time arrival and the crew which was friendly and helpful. You can fly to most destinations Lufthansa serves, for far less money and far better service with Emirates and Turkish Airlines. Even if you are prepared to pay more, I wouldn't fly Lufthansa. At that price, Singapore airlines offers a far superior experience. Quite frankly, I can't comprehend why anyone continues flying this airline.
450511678;Lufthansa;4;08.01.17;Dec 16;1;Domestic;Economy;Frankfurt;Berlin;3;2;;;1;3;;The final flight on the journey from Melbourne to Berlin. Short, comfortable enough but the boarding process was total chaos. Over 200 people trying to board at once. No queue just pushing and shoving and a complete mess. Expect better from such a busy airport. Maybe board like they do on bigger flights and start at the back! The flight itself was fine - crew were efficient and friendly. Seats were fine for a short flight.
450504517;Lufthansa;3;08.01.17;Dec 16;1;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Washington;;;;;;;;Weird seats with really lousy trays that fold up in the armrest differently than usual. Have to be slid back and forth to open or stow and can take a chunk out of your finger if youre not careful. HAVE to be stowed to get up and there is no other surface to put things or get some work done. Rotates but not enough to get up.Do NOT drink more than a small glass or two of the champagne or you'll get a headache from hell. Attendant got my food order wrong twice. Have had much better experiences on other airlines.

449984270;Lufthansa;5;06.01.17;Dec 16;1;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Rio de Janeiro;5;5;4;5;5;4;5;Lufthansa is my first choice usually and we chose it to make the transatlantic flight. The inbound flight from Germany to Brazil was simply perfect. It was on time. All the procedures - registration, security etc - went smoothly. After we boarded the plane, the experience was excellent. The service was very good, the flight attendant was extremely efficient and polite. The food was tasty. The drinks were unlimited. The entertainment system offered a lot of options. The only problematic issue was the queue to the bathroom. The outbound flight was worse. The flight attendants were a bit absent-minded and the food wasn't as good as the first flight but good anyways. The toothbrush was absent from the cosmetic box. Anyways the experience with Lufthansa in general was positive.

The First Class Lounge in FRA is perfect with great meal selection, new paper availability also in Italian language and Limousine service to the aircraft. As usual, at the exit of the plane once in SIN I found the LH Escort Manager to take me to the Passoport control and bags.

However, I traveled with my family this time and my father is in a wheelchair. As a million miler (so is my dad) with Star Alliance, I usually get preferred treatment but it took them one and a half hour to transfer my father from one gate to the next as they did 10+ hand offs. There was not one dedicated one person that took you from one gate to another. This is something that I would consider if you need a wheelchair or accommodations. It was a bit disappointing.

It was stressful. Check in went smoothly. The flight itself was very comfortable. Very spacious to seat. A very tasteful sandwich was served. I enjoyed my flights and I really recommend this company
449226815;Lufthansa;5;04.01.17;Jun 16;7;Domestic;Economy;Frankfurt;Berlin;;;;;;;;This is in my opinion a very good airline. the staff are very attentive. Flight prices are reasonable.
448213191;Lufthansa;1;01.01.17;Jan 17;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;San Francisco;;;;;;;;Nightmarish check in process, rude staff. Upon arrival the lines were very long, the passengers angry and frustrated. First you were forced to check in at the self help, long slow ine. Then forced to stand in another long line to drop off the luggage. Then the line for passport check went winding past the exterior exit doors. Once past the initial check there was an additional line that didn't move for 25 minutes. Security was additionally slow, then the long long line for a passport check. The process took 2 hours! Why are you forcing passengers through so many ineffective lines? People were routed through multiple lines for no reason, this was making many people angry causing verbal exchanges that made things worse combined with ugly verbally abusive staff. Choose a different airlines!
447796971;Lufthansa;1;30.12.16;Dec 16;0;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;London;;;;;;;1;Frankfurt airport was huge but very efficient, staff helpful until I got to the gate and Lufthansa staff took over. Very rude, told me to move for no apparent reason, made to queue over and over. This was my first visit to Germany Which had been very pleasant up until encountering Lufthansa staff. I have a major illness which is not apparent from the outside but I was still told to move. There had been no one sat there when I got there and no sign to say the seat was reserved in anyway. I was told to queue and queue again.Other than some power trip there was no reason for this behaviour, when I got to the front of the queue for the second time he was so rude to me I was nearly in tears, why?
447469149;Lufthansa;5;29.12.16;Oct 16;2;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Boston;5;5;4;5;5;4;3;I was lucky and got a premium economy ticket upgrade for a decent price. I have to say that premium economy was worth the money I have paid. On the way back I slept, which is not possible in economy. The second back is nice for some, but was not needed for me. But that there is a water bottle at your place if you sit down is very nice. If the additional price is not too high I will book for sure again premium economy. The only problem was that there were only 2 toilets available for the premium economy. There was a line in front of the toilet for the whole flight.

447320605;Lufthansa;1;28.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Tokyo;1;3;3;3;3;2;3;Lufthansa has managed to turn the clock back to the good old days of packing economy passengers in like sardines. The leg room was only 7.5 cm from the seat in front. It was so bad the tray table could not fold down fully. I am 180cm and 95Kg only. The seat cushion was sort and only came half way along my thighs and the seat felt narrower than normal. In fact I had more room on my connection flight from Barcelona. I think this airlines is a dinosaur and need to change their attitude towards their clients before they become extinct. Two more things, the controls on the armrest were so small you have no chance to see which is for the light and the touch screen GUI was terrible and had to navigate.

You can rely on them, they are serious, luggage almost always arrives at destinations, but the service is 4*. The food just ok, and the flight attendants feel so superior and not happy to work. They should definitely improve their staff. The middle east companies are taking over!The seats are ok, on the new 747-8, flat but not luxury.
446158399;Lufthansa;5;22.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Vancouver;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;The legroom was spacious, the entertinment center had exciting films, cd-s, documentaries about Lufthansa staff. But the best was the service. Good food was served accompanied by beer wine, liquer, whatever you wanted, and the staff didn't make face if you wanted a second or third drinks. They were kind and happy and no tjust on the surface but from the heart.

However, the night flight schedule helps you sleep. Interesting is that Lufthansa has on a A380/747 a row of 6 seats in business class and Singapore Airlines havs only 4 seats per row, which means you have much more room.The Lufthansa service feels ""fine"" whereas Singapore Airlines is ""great""."

444906186;Lufthansa;4;17.12.16;Dec 16;0;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Barcelona;;;;;;;;Good flight, plane ride was smooth and the service crew were pretty good. Not as good as on the longer flights but still worth mentioning they did a pretty good job.
444905797;Lufthansa;3;17.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Hong Kong;;;;;;;;The flight crew were amazing, likely the best experience we've had on a flight ever. The plane was the newer Airbus A380 (double decker plane). We were on the upper deck and the seats were just not the comfortable. We arrived in Frankfurt on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner and found that plane to be much preferred. The only saving grace was the great service from the flight crew.

Lufthansa is supposed to be a great airline and with safety in mind, they are. Boarding was quite ok at Frankfurt, though crowds made it difficult to get through the gate. This highlights the first issue - crowd control at the boarding gate. Although announcement said Business Class and Families with Children first, everyone ""stormed"" the gate - and being stopped they did not move aside to let the people pass through.Business Class seats are modern and in the 747 arranged at 2-3-2 but really lacked comfort. At least the aisle seat gave me a problem with my shoulder banging against the seat divider and the outside arm rest was a little too low - my seat was 12H. A big guy sitting in the row in front of us was unable to lie down because of this - so he spent the entire 11 hrs sitting upright.Entertainment was o.k. and sufficient for the trip. The attendant was very professional, nice and helpful.Food was average and lacked sophistication as can be found in other Airlines Business Class - from Frankfurt to Bangkok a Food arrangement serving more the German Palate. As entree Deer Pate, dinner was either Goose with dumplings and Red Cabbage or Salmon Trout (I took the Salmon Trout). I must say though the fish came with a delicious Lemon Grass Sauce but the Pearl Barley was out of place.Toilets are a little bit grubby already after 4 hours flight and lacking some features you will get elsewhere. The wet towelettes and Eau de Cologne was nowhere to be seen.There are only 2 toilettes for 21 Business Class seats and 16 first class seats.The first class seat arrangement did not look very different to Business Class - Emirates and Thai are on both classes better arranged and offer more."

No information: not by e-mail, not sms (Senator or gold with its' pedecessor (Qualiflyer) since 1999). My business goes elsewhere: a disgrace.... and the non response (automatic/unpersonal response) of their staff (LH and Miles and more) as the cherry on the cake. Sad to see such a great company being killed....

I missed flights again this month and I hope that this will not happen again in the upcoming weeks. It is really too bad that the excellent service is now being disrupted because the reliability is just not there.
443077790;Lufthansa;3;09.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Atlanta;3;2;4;4;4;2;2;The flight itself was not bad, and I was very impressed by the food and beverages. However, the flight attendant skipped my seat several times. I am not one to complain, so the first two times I let it go. The final time she came around, I asked for a hot towel to wipe my face and hands, as she'd already distributed them to all of the other passengers. Instead of bringing me one at first glance, she told me that she gave me one and pointed to it in my lap....it was a dry napkin. She did not apologize, but instead walked away and came back with a cold, wet towel and just moved on. My second not so great aspect of the trip, was that when I got home I noticed MAJOR damage to my luggage. One big crack on the bottom side and two punctures on the top(it was a hard case piece). I attempted to contact Lufthansa, and they informed me that if I did not notice the damage immediately and did not report anything to an agent at the airport, there was nothing they could do. Lesson learned, perhaps. However, I would have expected a little more from Lufthansa.

Lufthansa was efficient and the staff were polite but it suffered somewhat by comparison with Singapore Airlines. However there can be no real complaint about the flight or the service and we would happily fly with them again.
442431098;Lufthansa;1;06.12.16;Nov 16;1;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;London;1;1;1;1;1;2;2;I was lucky again to have booked a flight with Luftansa when the pilots decided to go on strike. It was not the first time this occurred to me. Someone always seems to be on strike at Lufthansa when I choose to fly with them...So my flight was cancelled which was very annoying. But what is even more annoying is the fact that since then, so for more than two weeks now I have tried to contact their customer service in order to get my money back for the canceled flight. If I call them there is only an electronic message saying that they are not available at the moment due to the large number of calls. And I have tried very, very often. I also tried to contact them via email, but did not get a reply either. It seems like they just turn on their answering machine in order to make people give in at some point.So if possible I will avoid flying Lufthansa in the future.
441771247;Lufthansa;2;03.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Sao Paulo;3;1;;;3;1;;Coming from Brazil to Europe, due to crew's strike, I had to change flights to Alitalia, what cost me to arrive 1 day later to my appointments. Now, on the way back, more annoyances were on stock. I got to the business lounge, presented my card and was informed that my status as frequent traveler has been upgraded to Senator and that I could go to the other lounge which offers more amenities. Of course , I was pleased and didn't care to walk all the way back there. The only thing is that when I arrived there, I learnt that my status has not been changed at all - it was some problem in the system - and thus, have to walk back to where I was in the first place.In the past, Lufthansa used to be a reliable company that would offer quality service without disturbances. Clearly, this is no longer the case.
441663754;Lufthansa;4;02.12.16;Nov 16;1;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Copenhagen;3;;;3;;;5;We flew from Hanoi to Frankfurt on Nov 28th and knew that our onward flight from Frankfurt to Copenhagen was cancelled due to the pilot strike. We found a service desk (better information on where they are would be great) and were promptly booked on a flight just 1,5 hours later than our original flight AND we were given a ‰âÂ10 voucher each to get something to eat as well. Impressed by the service. The flight itself was uneventful and short.
441515205;Lufthansa;5;02.12.16;Dec 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Houston;4;5;5;4;5;4;5;I was worried if Lufthansa (LH) would continue their strikes after 30th Nov, but luckily they didn't. So, I could take my flight. I checked in to the upper deck, seat 96 C (Aisle). The flight was great, but don't reserve this seat on this route. There is a metal box underneath the front seat so you can't stretch your legs. Apart from this, the flight was nice, air hostess were friendly and came to serve drinks and snacks at regular interval. Also, I exited through the business class exit and I made it quick to the immigration que. It took me 15-20 min to clear the immigration. Had I been in the lower deck it would have taken much longer as there were a lot of passengers and I saw them queing up in a huge line.Major advantages of traveling in the upper deck: You get served food and drinks very fast as there are less number of seats, you disembark through the business class exit and you can reach early to the immigration que (which could be quite long).

Good second serving. Very good night flight!

Children are welcome and are treated really well, as the business class food offering is not always to their taste, but all was done to ensure a culinary satisfaction for kids.Entertainmentwise it would be great to have the latest movies to choose from (at least 2-3), as it used to be.It was an efficient and professional German hospitality.

We are grateful to her for spending the extra time to assist us.

The food is okay, at least the cheap flights in Europe they will still offer you drinks and a sandwich which is really nice. Something that everyone should be aware of, is that Lufthansa WILL NOT let you go with an extra kilo, they are very precise about the baggage allowance.other than that i am satisfied with the surface

We felt really safe in this huge plane. It was a very quiet and calm flight.If technology greatly impressed us, we were disappointed by the food they served onboard. It was salty and had a strong taste, which made me want to drink water all the time.The entertainment options were good, as well as the space between seats.In a nutshell, we had a pleasant flight. No delays and no problems at all.

If I compare the business class to other company I prefere other airlines then Lufthansa.The seats look good but those are not so comfortable . A little bit hard and small.
437041669;Lufthansa;4;14.11.16;Nov 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Toronto;5;5;4;5;5;5;4;For the long flights, upgrading to Premium Economy was such a great idea. The seats were wider, and almost flat tilt feature which allows for great napping. The service is excellent, and the flight crew are so attentive. This is a fantastic option to fly in comfort and not having the pay for business class.
436874109;Lufthansa;4;13.11.16;Oct 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Shanghai;4;4;4;;4;4;4;Since many years LH is my favorite airline for intercontinental flights. The staff is not overfriendly but professional. Catering on board is sufficient. There is always a wide selection of drinks during the whole flight avaiabe. If there is no flight attendant passing drinks you can alway get some from the gally yourself. Try this on a KLM or China Eastern flight. As far as meals are concernt its difficult to judge because everyone has a different expectaion. In buisiness class, as far as I experianced it, food quality was always sufficiant to goos along with a even bigger selection of drinks. In Eco class over the past 5 years the food quality went from sufficient to disgusting back to sufficint again. In the new Premium Eco Class the food is arranged more nicely using ceramic pans and real glasses with helps to improve the overall impression.My favorite seats are the Premium Eco seats. Unlike the BC you can not recline them to a bedlike seat but offer enough comfort on a long sitance flight and catch some sleep. Once I tryed the bed function in the BC but was not happy about it because you lie in a kind of cave which allows you not to move your arms when you are bigger. So I went back to a normal deck chair position. The Premium Eco offers the same for a lower price, so its better value for you if you dont care so much about catering. The Eco class seats are pretty much standard for airliners. Not nice but even as a bigger person you can make a 10 -12h trip. Cleaniness was always ok, even the toilets during the flight. One time I got sick (dont know why)while flying over sibiria so the flight attendend noticed that immediantely and took care of me until the end of the flight.Regarding fares I have to say that LH offers best value in terms of time and money. Why should I save 300‰âÂ on a flight when I have to buy 3 - 4 extra (or more) hours of traveling time with a stop over in come desert country? Within Europe there are alternatives to LH (as far as the price is concerned) but overseas there is no better choise.
436424195;Lufthansa;3;11.11.16;Nov 16;0;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Manchester;3;4;4;2;2;3;3;We were lucky to book row number 12 (I think it was) without having to pÌÊy any extra charge. It is the row at the emergency exit with more legroom. The flight was on time, staff was friendly, just the food is getting poorer each time, currently it is at the level of the choice between cheese sandwich or ham sandwich. At least you can wash it down with a Warsteiner beer.

Could work on better packaging bearing the preservation of the environment. Too much waste!
434685354;Lufthansa;1;04.11.16;Oct 16;1;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Istanbul;4;1;2;1;1;2;2;I am writing this review after my recent disappointment with Lufthansa. After many years of not using this airline, I decided to book my flight Manchester-Frankfurt-Istanbul with Lufthansa. I was shocked by the poor customer service provided by Lufthansa and this particular cabin crew on my Frankfort-Istanbul journey on 29/10/16. When asked what the meal which was thrown on my table was, she responded chicken, to which I replied is there a vegeterian option as I'm vegetarian. She rudely responded Its only chicken otherwise I would have given you a choice! I have flown with different airlines in the past, and by far Lufthansa has been my worse experience. Rude and inconsiderate airline/cabin crew, one that would not be expected in this day and age from a European airline!

434585548;Lufthansa;5;04.11.16;Oct 16;1;International;First Class;Frankfurt;Tokyo;;;;;;;;While in my opinion LH does not have the most competitive hard product out there, their service was again outstanding. It is classy, stylish and polished. We had an excellent crew that was attentive, fast and always available. The food and beverage options on this flight were very good and I specifically enjoyed the Japanese option. The overall experience was fantastic and I will for sure fly with them again.
434570127;Lufthansa;5;04.11.16;Oct 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Toronto;4;5;5;5;5;5;4;Nice knowing that all airlines are not trating passanges as bus passengers. This 747 was full but the service was excellent and food and beverage service rewarding which is saying a lot.
434480292;Lufthansa;3;04.11.16;Dec 15;11;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Singapore;3;2;4;3;3;3;4;Well what to say. the service and the planes are good but Lufthansa is taking any cent extra they can get. Unfortunately I was not used to strict rules. I carried just a small 9kg bag and a 5 kg frame = 2 items. If you book it with the booking ahead you pay 15‰âÂ per kg but otherwise they ask for 45‰âÂ at the counter = 225‰âÂ no chance of flexibility,-( the service on board was okay but during the night it was difficult to find somebody.
434289597;Lufthansa;4;03.11.16;Oct 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Houston;4;5;5;5;5;4;4;Flight was only half full on a Tuesday. Good service, plenty of room, good flight entertainment. LH lounge will not accept United Airline passes.

Clearly, the one piece of hand luggage does not apply to all passengers so the hostess ended up shoving luggage in the overhead bins with no respect for any items stored there. Vests, coats, soft bags were just pushed and squeezed in with no regards to content or respect for the clothes. Meals were just eatable, no second offering for drinks was made and staff were loud during the sleeping time although not present for travellers. Overall a bad experience once again (we fly Lufthansa at least twice a year long haul). It used to be my favorite airline but I am on the verge of ""never again"""
433488181;Lufthansa;5;01.11.16;Dec 15;11;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Sofia;4;5;5;5;3;4;5;There may be a problem with this airline carrier only when another strike of theirs is called - something that happens almost on a regular basis. Otherwise a very reliable company: from pricing and ticketing to check-in and boarding procedures, etc. It is to be noted that they take part in different alliances, have daughter companies, etc., and are thus very flexible in their offers. You can almost always find a reasonably priced route, wherever in the world you are going to.

The 6 hour delay was not Lufthansa's fault, but their management of getting things fixed was poor. The service centre near the gates was shut and we had to go out and redo security which was a pain and inexcusable.When we finally boarded, the service and food on board was very good.Strangely, Lufthansa business seats are 6 abreast like in economy, with the middle seat kept empty. Would be better if they had 4 wider seats.
433248155;Lufthansa;3;31.10.16;Oct 16;0;Europe;Business Class;Frankfurt;Rome;2;2;;;1;;;As Frankfurt is such a busy airport I had to take a bus out to the aircraft. This is always inconvenient and uncomfortable as you have to carry your hand luggage up the steps. When I got to my seat the overhead locked was not big enough for my bag and got no assistance from the cabin staff. I eventually saw there was sufficient room on the other side. The cabin staff was not overly friendly or helpful. I was given a very ordinary tray of cold meat and cheese. The flight was only about one and three quarter hours. I disembarked through the air tunnel in Rome. The business class seats are the economy seats with the middle seat blocked. I did have enough leg room as I was in 1A but the seats behind me were close.

The headset didn't work properly so it was impossible to watch movies or listen to music during the long flight. Even worse the general monitor didn't work during safety features!!! and they did not fix it.At the beginning of the flight it was really hot on the aircraft, a couple of hours before arrival it was freezing on board.I will definitely choose other airlines for future flights.

The flight was fully booked but it felt comfortable with the kind cabin crew and useful information during a relatively short flight of about 50 minutes. Sandwich with salmon was also tasty meal.
433050817;Lufthansa;2;30.10.16;Oct 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Detroit;3;1;;;1;1;;Lufthansa has the most basic, no frills and poor business class service I have experienced.The lounges are extremely basic, with poor quality food, no choice and a limited selection of drinks.Overall is a sterile and unwelcome environment.On board the experience is similar, no luxury, no frills, very basic service, no extra care.Food is of poor quality and the service you receive on board is again very basic.Lufthansa is often one of the most expensive option in business but there is absolutely nothing to show for the extra cost.I find it inferior to the majority of other airlines but still the most expensive.I will avoid choosing lufthansa again on my business or holiday travels
432901584;Lufthansa;1;30.10.16;Oct 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Denver;3;1;3;1;3;1;1;"From one animal lover to another DON'T USE Lufthansa as an airline when traveling with pets!!! I will never use them again period. On October 26th 2016, we set out for a long trip back to the US after living in Europe for 16 years. We put both our grey cat Tater and our dog Bug in the hold. We had planned to have Tater with us in the cabin but he and his cage were too big for the cabin. Thank goodness we did. It was our choice to put him in the hold but had we not changed our minds, I cannot imagine where he would have gone in the cabin! Muffy, our 20 year old cat was with us but once on the flight, unlike Air France, they would not let us take her out of her cage or even set the cage on our laps during the 10 hour voyage. If I had any idea that Lufthansa was going to be so militant and animal-unfriendly, I would have done things differently. Early on in the flight, just as I had done on an Air France flight, I took her to the toilets (in her cage) and let her out in the toilets so that she could drink water and eat. She drank and drank as she normally does. As a 20 year old cat, she needed to drink and eat regularly and often. However, I had set the cage outside the toilet since there was not enough space in the toilets. When the flight attendants saw the cage on the floor, they went ballistic. A female flight attendant started screaming at me in German and a male flight attendant was screaming at me in English. They didn't even try to talk to me first! It was truly awful. I was not allowed to take her to the toilets to care for her after that. The worst part was that I wasn't able to choose our seats because when traveling with animals (with Lufthansa) you can only chose your seats at the counter when you check your animals in. The policy should be that those traveling with animals should have the same seat priority as those traveling with children. Unfortunately, with their current policy, by the time one checks animals in all of the good seats are gone. We ended up squeezed in the back with a woman on the inside seat. She was OK with cats but not with getting up. We couldn't bend down to Muffy's cage to feed her or water her unless she got up. David had to have Muffy at his feet. We couldn't even bring her up to eye level from time to time to check on her. We lifted her up at one point and were quickly reprimanded and not with kindness I might add. An empty seat in our section would have helped immensely. There were many combinations of three seats on the plane with only two people but we were not allowed to change as those people ""chose their seats in advance"". The flight attendant said to me that I should have done the same and would not listen to me when I explained that I hadn't been allowed to choose my seats in advance. Muffy survived the flight but she was not the same cat when she arrived in Denver that she was when she boarded the plane in Frankfurt. Before the flight she was full of life - even at 20 and was bouncing around our hotel room the day and night before. My vet felt 100% confident in her making the trip and her health had been carefully monitored. I blame Lufthansa Airlines for this drastic change in her health. It was due to their inhumane, insensitive and uncaring treatment of our cat and of our situation in general that Muffy ended up not surviving in the end. She never recovered her strength or the amazing constitution that she had had for an elderly cat. She died yesterday in my arms."

Anyway with this trip it was no brainer first choice (above Air France or Iberia). So impressed with the ease of boarding, delightful crew and of course being on time helped. Spotless cabin too.

If flying to or from Europe then I'd recomend flying in business as when by mistake I entered economy section I was in shock how messy it was.

No inflight tv screen, as entertainment program is transmitted via an app - anyone wants to watch it, has to install it prior to the flight - certainly a good saving initiative for the airline, but not much for its customer!We wanted to have ginger ale on the way back after one week in Crete where we could not find any, but to our disappointment, they also do not have!

Unfortunately we were delayed from the UK to Frankfurt, this meant that our next connecting flight to Moscow was missed.The flight from the UK was brilliant, snacks and refreshments were complimentary and this was a refreshing change, the service on arrival was also matched with excellenceOn arrival to Frankfurt, it was evident that the connecting flight may be rescheduled due to the delay, this was not planned, however, we appreciated the issue may have been a technical issue.We spoke to the Lufthansa staff to get the next available flight on the same day, the staff were brilliant and helped us 100% to enable us to enjoy our wedding anniversary.Following our rescheduled flight, I must mention a young man named Hichem DerbaliåÊ (i hope I spelt this correct). This young man was exceptional and I must express how professional and accommodating he was. Hichem assisted my wife and I onwards to Moscow and made us feel very valued as customers, his efforts from a customers perspective was exemplary.Our flight to Moscow was amazing, the cabin crew and flight crew were brilliant, immense customer service again.This is the first time we have experienced a flight with Lufthansa and we will definetly recommend the airline to our friends.May I add, if flights are delayed for any reason, it is genuinely a technical issue and the airlines try their very best to enable flyers to travel. My wife and I are regular worldwide travellers and this experience with Lufthansa has been exceptional.Well done to the staff of Lufthansa,We will be enjoying a flying experience with you again following this experience.Regards,Mr & Mrs Brady

428958845;Lufthansa;2;17.10.16;Oct 16;0;Europe;Business Class;Frankfurt;London;2;3;3;4;3;2;4;My husband and I flew with Lufthansa for the first time and although the flight experience was fine, we found the reservation and support staff were inefficient, rude and generally very little help when a problem arose. When we arrived in London one piece of our luggage did not arrive on the same flight. We were informed that it would be on the next flight and we would be notified as to its progress. My husband was presented with a bag containing toiletries as these were some of the items we were missing. Presumably it was for both of us but when we arrived at our destination, it turned out to be only items for a gentlemen. Our luggage did not arrive for 48 hours and when I contacted Lufthansa to get some assistance, they were, to say the least, less than helpful and the attitude of the agent was appalling. After some discussion with the agent, they reluctantly told me that they would pay 100% for toiletries and 25% of any clothes we had to purchase. When I checked in online on the return, I spoke to an agent from Lufthansa for a bit of help and they were again very rude. Unfortunately this has clouded my experience with this airline and I doubt I would travel with them again. Also note that to get to actually speak to an agent took a minimum of one half hour on hold.

The sandwich is always a welcome treat and they have a good beverage selection.Two complaints but not really Lufthansa's fault. Frankfurt is such a zoo these days and when one has to board the bus out to the parking areas it just adds to the inconvenience. The other of not being able to put my hand bag under the seat when sitting in an exit row. I understand the theory, in reality though it is non-starter.Good airline, great staff

428748458;Lufthansa;1;17.10.16;Oct 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Denver;1;3;3;1;4;1;1;Years ago when I started traveling internationally, even sitting in economy class was a pleasurable experience. Sufficient space, legroom and fine meals and service. I suppose the thought was the costs are higher and the trips longer and that's the right thing to do.This flight I was on yesterday was just awful. I literally sat in less space than I had later on a connecting US domestic flight on a regional aircraft. Plus the aircraft Lufthansa had sat 4 in the middle, and had only 3 under the seat in front of you spaces, meaning that the middle two passengers (one of which was me) had to split our legs between spaces and we all didn't have sufficient personal storage space under the seats in front of us.Lastly the food is just amazingly bad. I never thought I would see the day when US domestic meals are better than international economy class, but that was just wrong. To be on a flight of almost 10 hours and have such bad food, most of it weird and inedible, is just wrong.I don't recommend Lufthansa for economy class service.

In any case - the secondary check took forever and despite being most cooprative - the guards were called to ""look over"" us. The whole ordeal was wholly annoying and completely redundant. It cost us 15 minutes and cost Lufthansa a Frequent business traveler and his family.Flight was uneventful - except for the food which was inedible. Probably worst airline food I ever came across.

And the airport itself can be a nightmare and most certainly was the last time I transited through. On my arriving flight from Portugal we waited on the tarmac for a ground crew to arrive and bring stairways to allow us to leave the plane, only to then get on a bus to take us to the terminal. From touch down to actually walking into the terminal was at least 40 minutes. I felt very bad for the very stressed out passengers with tight connections. I had a 2 and a half hour connection and really just had enough time to walk forever, through customs, towards my gate where I had about a half hour to sit and eat something. I then went to the gate for my flight to Montreal and found that I had to again board a bus and another 15 minute drive to the actual aircraft. Once on board and ready to go, we again waited for a crew to push our plane back and we ended up leaving almost an hour late.I've been through Frankfurt a number of times and realize that it is a huge operation but it's a ton of walking and several elevators or stairwells to navigate to reach connecting flights. There are some wonderful newer spaces there but if you have any sort of difficulty walking I would not recommend a tight connection here.

They took our passports and gave us a new boarding card with the famous First Class logo on it. Terminal food was excellent. Choice of wine and ""bubbly"" was also great. I also visited the showers to freshen up after a long day before our long flight to South Africa (I also wanted the ultimate proof of visiting this terminal - the famous rubber duck). When it was time for departure, the lady that met us when entering the terminal found us and guided us to a private car outside the terminal. This car drove us to the airplane. The royal treatment was continued onboard the airplane... Excellent food (did not know I would like caviar, but that was an experience!).

I originated my travels in Nuremberg and transferred in Frankfurt. Our flight de-planed on the tarmac and while everyone else boarded a bus for transfer to the terminal, I was met by a chauffeur who took me directly to the first class lounge (after clearing passport control) where I enjoyed a cocktail and then was again taken by chauffeur to my connecting flight. Once onboard, the pampering continued with pre-departure nuts and champagne. The flight crew was friendly and professional and made for a very enjoyable flight. I chose to sleep for the majority of the flight rather and opted out of meal service so I can't comment on the food quality. On arrival at Dulles, first class passengers were met at the jet bridge and driven in a van directly to Immigrations, avoiding the ""moon buggy"" transfer, which was quite a time saver. Lufthansa certainly impressed."

Frankfurt is enormous with all that implies: excellent depth of service, long transfers sometimes. Lufthansa seats have gotten much better, and the cabin crews are friendly, the videos good (I really am not using my tablet much), and the food tasty. You have to do it their way, it is very German. A fair trade-off.

425932234;Lufthansa;3;07.10.16;Aug 16;2;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Los Angeles;3;3;3;4;3;2;4;Lufthansa just completed the deployment of their new business class for all destinations around the world. Still, I try to avoid it when I can. I find the quality/price ratio questionable and it's still not on par with other airlines, although connection times in Frankfurt and Munich towards Asia and US are really good.1) As the seats' configuration is 2-2-2, only the 2 center aisle seats give you aisle access all the time without being disturbed by your neighbour or disturbing your neighbor. It's one of the few airlines I know that still does not have a fully-staggered business class system or something similar. (see ANA, Swiss, Singapore airlines)2) The cabin lacks of privacy. There is neither physical nor visual separation btw you and your surrounding neighbors. Furthermore, the convergence of two adjacent seats (see seatguru.com) is quite weird so that your and your neighboard's feet point at each other with just a tiny panel that separate them in the middle.3) There is very limited storage place. A fraction of what you have with other airlines (again, Swiss, ANA, Singapore Airlines,..). You often have to move stuff in and out from the storage places to get access to things you needThe rest is more or less on par with other airlines...
425888843;Lufthansa;3;07.10.16;Jan 16;9;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Atlanta;2;3;3;2;3;3;3;The staff was friendly and they made sure you had plenty to drink. The food was the worst I have had of any airline, I am not expecting a gourmet meal or anything but something that is actually edible. We were in the process of moving to Germany and they were the only airline that would help us get our Boxer over here. However I requested a window seat at check in when I was given my ticket I was in am isle seat. I showed the lady at the desk my online printed receipt where is stated I reserved a window seat. She said whatever and refused to fix it. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal but I hate having to get up and move for people trying to go to the restroom, so I always get a window seat to avoid this.

Disorganised security, dark and always very warm inside. Lufthansa business lounge acceptable if a little plain. Priority boarding non-existent. I don't really understand why we started boarding and only then did the catering crew arrive, causing congestion at the L1 door as they were using L2.

It was perfectly on time and arrived as scheduled. If they want to serve food that people will eat, they have a long way to go, but for us this was no problem. We had a couple of hours in the senator launch waiting for our flight, were the food served was very good.
425605816;Lufthansa;4;06.10.16;Oct 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Johannesburg;4;5;4;4;5;4;3;"Premium economy is worth the money because you have more ""air"" between the seats, more leg space and this class has much better food and service. Also, this class has more isle seats and the seat comfort is better than the one in economy. On this flight everything worked out perfect and to my families satisfaction."
425536267;Lufthansa;4;06.10.16;Sep 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Boston;4;5;5;3;5;4;5;I booked Lufthansa for a direct flight from Frankfurt to Boston. You have to fly for about six and a half hours, but Lufthansa made the trip more enjoyable. You have enough spaced to store the biggest carry on luggage. Even though I am a tall person, my knees did't touch the front seat. Everybody had a small screen built inside the seat with a huge amount of movies. I recommend you using their headphones, because I couldn't use mine. The stewardesses tried to provide us with food. The food wasn't as good as expected but still more tasteful than the food of other airlines. In conclusion, the service of Lufthansa was very satisfying.
425063315;Lufthansa;5;04.10.16;Jul 16;3;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Kuwait;5;5;4;4;4;4;5;It was my first time traveling on business class on Lufthansa. For some reason when I tried to book my flight, business class was cheaper than flying on Premium Economy?! Staff were very friendly as usual, I love how considerate they are when you are sleeping. I've flown on many different airlines, and the thing I hate most is when they wake you up for the meals (that has happened to me regardless of the class I'm traveling on). Being able to get a good sleep on the business class seat/bed truly made my flight comfortable.
424780025;Lufthansa;1;03.10.16;Oct 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Boston;3;1;2;1;3;1;2;"To say this trip was bad is like saying Katrina was a minor inconvenience. Let's begin with the first service, drinks before lunch/dinner. Like many Europeans they treat ice like a controlled substance, and only by begging did I manage to get 2 cubes in my Vodka. The drink barely wetted the bottom of the glass in any event, one is tempted to say ""why bother?"" Next came dinner. I have Celiac Disease, so I had ordered a gluten-free dinner. Obviously they have one special meal, suitable for vegetarians, lactose intolerants, gluten-free passengers, and any other dietary restriction. I'll call it mystery blob. Apparently they individualize the meals by adding a small portion of something, in my case they put some strips of mystery meat in a little plastic thingie to complement my blob. I'd feel paranoid except for the fact that my wife's non-gluten-fee meal was, in her opinion, worse. I wrestled another drop or two of vodka out of the female Panzer commander, this time with one cube.Occasionally they would drop by with some other horror potion"
424775205;Lufthansa;1;03.10.16;Oct 16;0;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;London;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;We had a 4hr drive to the airport which ended up taking 7hrs (clearly not Lufthansa's fault). We were left on hold for over 30 minutes to explain we would not make the flight & were quoted an additional å£300 + per person! For a family of 4 that soon adds up! We thought they may be more helpful at the airport but same response - poor rudeness. When they eventually did book the flight they expected my 4year old daughter & 10 year old to sit on their own in the middle of strangers. the plane as already moving when they queried why my daughter remained on my husbands lap. I will do my upmost to avoid flying with these unhelpful people in future.

424456256;Lufthansa;5;02.10.16;Oct 16;0;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;London;;;;;;;;Lufthansa,Lufthansa,Lufthansa....been flying Lufthansa for some years now without any issues until recently precisely Sunday 2nd October 2016, I was about to board my 06:30 flight of 07:00am departure,I arrived at the boarding gate at exactly 06:50am but unfortunately the lady at the boarding gate refused me to board at that time. I was so devastated not knowing what to do as I had to go back to London after spending the night with friends in Frankfurt at that point I was asked to go to the Lufthansa service centre,upon arrival I was impressed with the first class customer service rendered by a Gentleman I met at the counter,this Gentleman was exceptional he went out of his way to find out the reason I was late to the gate and found out it was due to delay at security gate, unfortunately my ticket was not refundable or changeable which means I have to buy a new ticket to travel back to London. In the process of buying a new ticket while completely frustrated then comes the ray of hope....the Gentleman at the counter came back to me from the back office and said I have been given an exception and will be issued a free ticket to travel back to London on the 08:00am flight.... I was full of Joy and appreciation...Infact I cannot thank the Gentleman and Lufthansa enough...I'm more than grateful!

It's not that I don't like winter. I do but only for a short period of time. I am like a white storks. It is much harder for them to travel that far than for me. You can't compare it with my flight on Lufthansa wings. Trip was from Frankfurt to Johannesburg.Pleasant one. Staff was very friendly, food tasty as it can be from those Sky chefs. Red wine was good. Only problem with this economy class was that I couldn't stretch my legs, like a white storks do, when they fly. To cope with this little unconformity, helps me thinking about my Love and sunny Johannesburgawaiting for me.

Loads of space and great service. Very impressive, large wash room.Sleep comfort is good as you are given a (thin) matress which makes your seat less hard for sleeping.Whiel Lufthansa recent concept of the First Class is very nice they did have a different setting a few years back. At that time you had a sort of a small cabin with your seat and and extra bed. This was absolutely perfect. Not sure why they ""down-scaled""."

We will NEVER be using them again!!!! We booked for four of us and when we arrived 'early' to the airport we found our seat's were all over the plane in the middle seat with none of us together. Not only did this happen to us, but also the person beside me was from a group of 5 and the same had happened to them. Nobody could or wanted to help, we were sent all over the airport to get at least 2 of us together as my daughter is an anxious flyer. No help was offered, infact they just said that is the way it is tough. Every other code share with star alliance put's travellers together, we have never been seperated EVER! We had no option but to sit apart. The cabin crew kitchen was near my seat and I could hear their conversation's. They said it was going to be one of those flights and wanted it over fast and at one point when someone rang for the crew they said they wouldn't be going to help. They were arrogant, unhelpful, rude to the person next to me and very pushy if you got in their way. A very bad experience and one I will not be repeating.

If I use Lufthansa it would be short haul flights in Europe. They are using the same terrible A319 and A320 with just about nil legroom in business so you might just as well fly economy as your legroom is just as bad.After they built out Frankfurt airport it has become the horror of me as traveler. You have to wander around like a lost soul till you find your gate.I was lately flying to Stockholm and had to walk more that half an hour to the gate. On the bus to the plane they gave us a sightseeing tour of half an hour of the airport at night till they found the plane tucked away as far away from the gate as possible.Now that is Lufthansa for you and do avoid Frankfurt airport which is likely the worst in Europe.
423606919;Lufthansa;4;29.09.16;Sep 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Chicago;3;5;5;;2;5;5;It was a pleasure to ride Lufthansa because of the excellent service and their punctuality. The staff works hard to make you feel welcome and that they like their jobs by smiling, and offering anything they can do to make the flight more enjoyable. The plane was full and everyone was crammed into their seats, but that's life in economy. What makes it better is friendly people. They also have Lufthansa staff located throughout the airport to offer directions and answer questions which came in handy. The only reason I didn't give it an excellent was that their movie selection. although there were many offered, left a little bit to be desired.

This airline is a joy in business class. Superb food. Beautiful aircraft. Courteous and professional staff. Great boarding experience. Terrific lay flat capsule seats. Great non stop connections. Our connecting flight from Mulhouse was only an hour flight. They served a terrific breakfast. I wish they could fly domestic US routes!

I got bruises on my legs because I put my legs under the seat in front of me and there is not enough space and sharp edges. Also there is still the old button in the place where you put your hands and I accidentally turned off my neighbours movie two times. There is touch screen, why should I ever want to use wired controller hidden in the seat?In comparison with Swiss Air Boing 777 on flight back, sitting in this plane felt like 10 years ago.On short flights (Prague to Frankfurt) there is no food at all.
423442367;Lufthansa;5;29.09.16;Oct 15;11;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Miami;4;4;5;3;5;3;5;A380 is a big aircraft. 9 out of 10 you won't really feel the turbulance that you might feel with smaller airplanes. I prefer flying with Lufthansa when it comes to transatlantic flights. The food is descent but there's nothing special about it, on the other hand when it comes to safety I believe LH is way up ther, at the top.I highly recommend it.

Comparing with other airliners I found little bit less space for legs in the economy class but the rest remained similar. I was surprised by very good meals onboard + snacks + enough quality drinks available. The crew was very friendly, despite of having bad weather the flight was not ""bumpy"". The price for the flight was very good as well, so for me it was very nice experience."

423371733;Lufthansa;4;28.09.16;Sep 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Seoul;4;4;4;4;5;4;3;Very nice flight. The new business class seats are very good. Had seat 14A onboard the A380. Row 14 is in-between two service attendants areas, meaning that you get a little bit forgotten at times. I would recommend to try to get row 15 or lower than 13 instead. The space for the feet is a little bit small and I missed a place to put the phone. The little space where the usb charger port is located is not a very safe place for the phone when you move your seat up and down. (They do warn you about these kind of problems on the audio at takeoff.) Otherwise the staff was very nice and food was good.

I was wrong - Lufthansa has the same class of service with a German twist. Wonderful food, free beer and wine on board (and not junk, either...) I watched the latest Star Wars movie on a flight months before it was released to DVD (again, free - I would say 85% of the flight was watching Star Wars on their personal screens over the Atlantic that night, it was rather humorous!) Classy, comfortable flight, great service. If you fly transatlantic, be sure to fly a carrier who knows how to do it right. So far, Lufthansa and British Airways have proven to provide a much better experience than any of the US based airlines I've flown.

( should have been at least 4200 ) In Croatia converted $500 US ( on the street ) got the US exchange rate ,no charges ended up with 3200 Kona. Possibly this true of all airports in world ,so beware. Frankfurt airport is huge, in area B which is Lufthansa's area is where all good food outlets are, when you leave that area to get back you have to go though security again. ( this is not a complaint, the more security the better ) just that food outlets options are poor rest of airport

I have been flying Lufthansa for over 20 years and 17 for my professional career. They are my favorite airline for their punctuality, their service and their predictability. Yes, they don't offer the type of food you will find in Singapore airlines or Thai, or Emirates. The other airlines probably offer better pillows or blankets. But Lufthansa always offers the same proper service across ALL of their destinations. They have perhaps the largest network and when stepping inside their plane you know what to expect. Yes they have had their misses too. Cancellations, delays and booking issues. But they always get resolved with punctuality!

I had travelled the same airline from Hong Kong to London a month earlier in premium economy and can vouch that both are very comfortable. The main difference is that in business class the seats really do make up to a flat bed so you can get a comfortable sleep. The food, beverage and general service was excellent.

They were unhelpful about pre-ordered vegetarian food, and one of them spent an hour talking loudly to a passenger - at 2am when everyone was trying to sleep. Fourteen hours is a long time to spend in a plane with grumpy staff. Do yourself a favour and go with any other airline. I would never, ever fly with them again.

The flight actually took 15 mins less than expected so we only lost 15 mins great service as always.

I am not sure when they started offering this, but I certainly appreciated that.
421666547;Lufthansa;3;24.09.16;Sep 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Tel-aviv;2;3;3;3;1;2;3;Things didn't get off to a good start when I realised that the flight destined for Tel-aviv had its own special security area at Frankfurt meaning that I could not get to the lounge without negotiating various security checks. But at least the flight was on time.Boarding for business class passengers started early enough giving plenty of time to settle down. The seats were normal economy seats with the middle seat left vacant for a little more space. Legroom was reasonable. But having flown so frequently recently on Emirates (including shortish haul flights) the contrast with Lufthansa is sadly enormous. There is no welcoming champagne, no in flight WiFi and the interior is just of another (inferior) class. My enthusiasm picked up slightly when I read the information about the Lufthansa Entertainment app but my hopes were dashed when I read that I had to download this before the flight to access any entertainment (which I didn't know in advance). On a flight of 3 1/2 hours having no entertainment is another disappointment.Shortly after take off the crew came around with the drinks trolley. I was saved by a stiff gin and tonic and a hot towel...A little while later the evening diner trolley came down the aisle. I had the gnocchi with spinach, a glass of red wine and another G & T. Things were beginning to look up. The meal itself was tasty and I particularly like the bag of sugar coated almonds at the end. The rest of the flight was just boring. No entertainment, no way to recline the seats but at least we were on time.

421071869;Lufthansa;4;22.09.16;Aug 16;1;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Barcelona;4;5;;;1;;;We were given status as we were flying Business class into Europe and have Senator status. As a consequence we were given priority seats at an emergency exit. (10E &F) They were very good. Sat next to us was a crew member who address us by name. In fact all the crew in this area did. A pleasure of having status. The flight is short with a full service of food and beverage. Given where we were we were offered extras including a nice Spanish Roja wine. The downfall of the seats was there is no window to look out from. A good flight for a short time. CleanComfortable Good service
420085417;Lufthansa;2;19.09.16;Sep 16;0;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Budapest;3;1;3;2;1;2;1;The boarding process was very slow and they did not indicate where to stand in lines. The stewardess talked to me in a very unpleasant manner.
420069013;Lufthansa;4;19.09.16;Sep 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Mumbai;2;2;5;3;3;3;5;Very good DIRECT flight - No hassle with stop overs etc. Duration was 8 hours. The food served was piping hot and wholesome. The veg meal had palak paneer / rice / Lotus Root vegetable, along with Salad, Yoghurt and Drinks. No dessert served. The snacks given were Nuts & a Panini veg. The air stewardess' were not the best though..Rude at times too if you ask questions. Comfort level in the aircraft was not very good. Seats are small even e Emirates or Etihad aircraft.The route was completed on time which was a plus.
420014028;Lufthansa;4;18.09.16;Sep 16;0;Europe;Business Class;Frankfurt;Budapest;3;5;5;3;;4;5;Because of the lack of personal & amazingly long and slow lines at passport control in FRA I missed my connection to BUD, so headed to one of the business class lounges there where they could assist me with the next flight. How glad I did it this way. The customer service agent in the Lounge, Herr R Tufi, could not have been nicer so I was efficiently booked on the next flight to BUD. He had seen in my record that I had requested wheelchair assistance (recovering broken leg and wrist). Without hesitation, he ordered me a wheelchair, a senior person to collect me in the lounge and take me privately to my plane parked on the tarmac about 3 miles away from the lounge. He also sent a message to BUD for similar assistance.I did not know this, but because of the size of FRA, the Airport and Lufthansa have teamed up & have a program to assist travelers who have limited walking capabilities.I was told, the walk to connecting flights can be up to 4 miles. That's four miles folks! I certainly would not want to be walking that distance with carry on luggage in tow under any conditions. So, congratulations goes out to LH & the FRA Airport Authority for offering this service to all travelers.

Did chose a window-seat to north to maybe be able to get a view of Greenland but unfortunately not this time due to clouds. However the flight was good with welcoming and alert staff. The economy seat was good, even better than I thought so the flight duration of 9 hours went quite good.

For an early morning flight we were served a breakfast sweet roll and for an afternoon flight we were served a cake. During an evening flight we were given our choice of a few different types of sandwiches! Very different from the small bag of peanuts one is thrown on a U.S. flight!

Sadly on our way back the story was very different.Flying economy we were at the receiving end of the worst service we have ever experienced flying long haul (20+ return flights Australia-Europe).The child ""gift"" was a pencil with a tiny booklet - great way of dealing with kids Lufthansa.The cabin crew almost didn't exist. The meals were distributed and the plane went into the ""night mode"" - there was no follow up service with drinks (hot, alcoholic or others). Similarly, after the next meal there was no follow up service offering anything. Whatever rubbish has accumulated the flight was not even collected before landing.Worst. Service. Ever.Our next flight, code shared with Singapore Air, was like comparing chalk and cheese despite the fact that we flew an older and less modern aircraft. The crew was smiling, professional and attentive.Will not fly Lufthansa long-haul ever again."
418184180;Lufthansa;3;13.09.16;Sep 16;0;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Porto;3;2;;;1;;;We flew from Turku Finland via Stockholm and Frankfurt to Porto and back. Going out it was Lufthansa already from Stockholm, but coming back only until Frankfurt. Service onboard was exceptionally good going out. It made us feel special. But it was like cold shower coming back. I could hardly believe that this was the same airline company. When flying out we said that for such a nice flight we were willing to pay quite some money, but coming back was like a real low-cost flight, except it was not!
418184030;Lufthansa;2;13.09.16;Sep 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Washington;2;3;3;2;4;4;1;I normally try to avoid Lufthansa as I've had multiple bad experiences but they just had a killer price for my Euro trip (650$ roundtrip economy), so I didn't expect much (food has been continuously getting worse, legroom smaller over the years) but was still disappointed. The whole boarding experience on my way back was awful. They herded us through a stairway behind the gate in Frankfurt to get down to a bus. It was hot (no air condition in this area), we were standing on the stairs carrying our hand luggage, nothing was running smoothly, older people had trouble maneuvering, and then were shoved in the busses like sardines to get to the airfield. Major inconvenience. People were sweating, swearing, kids were crying. This was a huge plane, fully booked and the logistics around it were awful. Once boarded, the service was ok but limited. The lady next to me wanted a ginger ale, they didn't have that so the flight attendant offered her sprite instead. Food was as expected just tolerable. In addition we ended up with quite a delay so I almost didn't make my connection. I've had much better experiences with Delta but again, sometimes you can't beat Lufthansa prices.

NO leg room, huge metal box under seats taking up to light leg room available. With a leg disability this was a major issue for me. I will never fly with this carrier again.
417274709;Lufthansa;4;11.09.16;Jul 16;2;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Budapest;3;2;4;5;4;4;2;Good food and drinks. Clean conditions. The check is so so. It depends on who you get. I found them not very accommodating at times with seat changes, etc. We were flying as a family of four and had separated seats (don't know why we got seats automatically assigned like that). Asked for seat changes. No help at all. In general i either got a lot of indifference and plain rudeness or very courteous service at check-in. I got both this summer in my two trips to Europe from Canada to Romania.
417246958;Lufthansa;5;11.09.16;Sep 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Shanghai;5;4;5;5;4;4;5;We flew on the A380 and it was reasonably full. The service was great (with one exception) and the food excellent. It was nice that the special menu meals were supplied at the same time as the normal menu's. Often my wife and I eat at separate times as the gluten free meal arrives far earlier.The exception was the coffee that my wife tipped over herself two hours before landing. Okay it was during the breakfast service but despite many pushes on the call button no one came. Eventually the coffee dried but this was not a good response from the crew.I have to say that their menu selection while varied included few recent releases.

What a difference!The USA flight was of course two hours late, and staffed by ""could care less"" individuals. It was not at all easy for the Lufthansa staff to get me on another of their flights in business class, but they persisted with United until it was authorized. Their agent found me later, shopping in the terminal!Thanks Daniella!!They have icecream in their club!"
416598914;Lufthansa;4;09.09.16;Sep 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Chicago;2;4;1;2;3;3;4;This is my second trip from Kiev to Chicago connecting through Frankfurt Germany airport on Sept 6, 2016. Traversing the Frankfurt Airport from my arriving flight from Kiev is an exercise in itself. But this time the jetway worked. The walk through ramps, escalators, stairs, trams in itself is frustrating, and the loooooooong walk through concourse Z is difficult for the normal walker let alone for someone who has a handicap. I made it. Loading onto the plane was painless this time. It was efficient. Our plane is the 747-8, the largest in the Lufthansa fleet so loading the passengers is time consuming. I found my seat with ease, in economy. I have my usual complaints about being squeezed into economy seats on long flights. I have said it many times, it is inhumane. The flight left on time and arrived on time. The flight was uneventful except a little girl vomited on a seat and on the floor next to my seat. No one came to clean it up off the floor. The smell was evident. The food was mediocre. I had Goulash with potatoes. The flight attendants were adequate in their service and all could speak English. The only problem is they served the last meal very shortly before arrival and everything seemed rushed. The entertainment was okay, nothing special. I could never figure out how to use the wifi. Instructions were not existent or hidden some where in some magazine. Unloading from the 747 was very slow. When we got out to the jetway, there was a line of attendants with wheel chairs, allowing a single file line through the tramway causing a backup. Frustrating. It seems in my six experiences with Lufthansa over the past two months those experiences have been mediocre. Oh, one last thing. I had attempted to upgrade at the Munich airport on an incoming flight. I was told I would have to do that when checking in or at the flight deck. Their magazine said I could upgrade at Lufthansa Service Desk, I was refused. What is with this. Another thing I made my reservation through United Airlines. I could not select a seat. What gives? I thought a Star Alliance partnership was to make things more efficient for the passengers?
416399983;Lufthansa;4;09.09.16;Aug 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Bogota;4;3;4;3;4;3;3;My first time in Premium Economy, and paid around 300 euros for the upgrade. The seat was wider than in the economy class with more legroom as well. I suppose the food was the same than in the economy, but the wine was served in a proper glass. And I also got a menu. The long flight went smoothly thoug the departure was delayed, but we arrived to Bogota on schedule.

416301262;Lufthansa;5;08.09.16;Jul 16;2;International;First Class;Frankfurt;Buenos Aires;;;;;;;;The flight was as usual very nice and on time. The words of the Captain always so important for the passengers. Lufthansa s crews are the ones that make a real difference. I travel often and in different classes and I ve noticed such caring human beings involved in our safety and wellbeing. Sometimes people board planes with worries, anxiety, tiredness and a smile means more than one can imagine... it can change a journey... I regret I don t remember all the names but I remember Carmen, from last flight, a canadian flight attendant who lives in Torino. She was so kind... Thank you Carmen and all of you Lufthansa s cabin crew for sharing those caring moments with us passengers... !

Having flown numerous times in business and first I was not sure whether I am going to find it comfortable. I was positively surprised. The legroom was comfortable. The seat recline was good enough and I managed to sleep quite well. The food and beverages were also totally satisfactory. The cabin crew was friendly and attentive. The only let down was the boarding in Frankfurt: after queuing for quite a while we were bused to a remote stand in an incredibly crowded bus.

For 24 hours now no one can assist me with my lost luggage. No one from the company knows where the bag was scanned last, if it made to the plane in Frankfurt or not. Everyone just advises to check online via tracking through your website.

414943579;Lufthansa;5;05.09.16;Aug 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Miami;;;;;;;;This was my first time flying in Lufthansa and I have to say that all the positive reviews I'd heard were absolutely true. The service and boarding efficiency were excellent. The entertainment options were second to none. The camera views of the Airbus 380 were quite the eye opener, especially for folks like myself who enjoy those types of views. The aircraft was relatively clean with decent air quality. A true enjoyment for a 10 hour flight.
414941464;Lufthansa;2;05.09.16;Aug 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Newark;3;1;4;4;4;3;1;The following has been a recurring issue (happened twice before) that I have only experienced with Lufthansa in Frankfurt. Each time I have arrived at the airport on time, checked my bag, and proceeded to go to the gate. However, the security check was unusually long which made me miss my flight. My luggage was taken off the plane and the LH rebooking counter always refuse to rebook the flight without payment of a full fare despite the security officer accompanying me to the counter explaining to them that I was held up at security. I ended up purchasing a return ticket from American Airlines.
414723834;Lufthansa;4;04.09.16;Mar 16;6;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;London;4;5;5;3;3;4;5;I like Lufthansa very much based on years of experience traveling within Europe and cross Atlantic (USA). They are a well known and prestigious airline and they know their job. Planes are well maintained, even thought they are not always using the latest models (e.g. flying 747's on some routes instead of A380's or 787's).Personnel is well trained, friendly and knowledgeable. Especially the personnel is for me an important part, because you really have the feeling that these are professionals that know what they are doing. That they are there to help and that they have some freedom to make those decisions (compared for instance to the golf state cabin staff).The downside however is that the personnel is organized in unions and there have been a number of strikes in the recent years. So while they do not happen very frequently, if they affect your travel planing, I image this being a big problem.Price wise they are not the cheapest, but they are worth their money.
414454903;Lufthansa;4;04.09.16;Aug 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Bangalore;4;4;3;3;3;4;4;Lufthansa is a very efficient airline especially for web and in person check-in . They advertise a lot about their meals on Indian TV but the food is disappointing.It makes a difference especially as these are long distance flights of 9-10 hours. Entertainment too needs to be made more current. The screens and tech are wonderful however. I flew both ways on this route. I found a new warmth in their air crew that was lacking earlier. Frankfurt airport staff too have become more helpful.
414424384;Lufthansa;1;03.09.16;Jul 16;2;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Auckland;3;1;3;3;3;1;1;I bought a return flight from New Zealand to the UK with Lufthansa, and broke the journey for 3 days in San Francisco. Due to my own poor planning I arrived at the check in desk at San Francisco 45 minutes before the flight and was denied boarding (their cut off is 60 minutes) which wasn't great but is fair enough. They stated that the rest of my return flight was unaffected, and that I only had to pay for a new flight from San Francisco to London. However, 2 days before my return flight from the UK to New Zealand, I contacted then to confirm everything was OK and they said I now had to pay a å£4466 reissuing fee, 3 times the original price of the ticket and over 5 times the cost of buying the same flight with a different airline with 3 days notice, which is what I chose to do instead in the end. This is a short summary of a very stressful time with innumerable call centre staff members, all of which seemed perfectly polite and continuously gave me conflicting information as to whether I had a valid ticket or not, and every single one of the interactions generated no paper trail or email correspondence. They just left me stranded in a completely unreasonable way.
414341153;Lufthansa;5;03.09.16;Aug 16;1;International;First Class;Frankfurt;San Francisco;;;;;;;;"I write in praise of Lufthansa's Frankfurt First Class Lounge. It helped that we were tired and the lounge empty (mostly). It especially helped that the staff recognized our fatigue and was solicitous and courteous.We lacked proper handy proper documentation (inadvertently checked into a sent bag from a connecting Stockholm flight...) and we all know that our German brothers and sisters prefer proper documentation. Proper procedures required (we were told politely but firmly) physical documentation whereas we could only produce *electronic* documentation (smartphone/email). It seemed we were at an impasse. But the manager judged our fatigue, took pity on our weeping toddler....and...waived us through (""just this one time"" and ""next time you must have your proper papers""...). We went from depths of despair to elation.The lounge itself is understated, elegant, well-appointed, modern and clean. The food was excellent. We had champagne in hand quickly and treats and toys for our toddler.Thanks Lufthansa! We will remember that and we will choose you again as a result."

On the not so good side: average movies selection, lack of liquor choices (just german brandy and no whisky at all), seats generally difficult to set upright . Good enough, but decidedly not among top airlines.

411364886;Lufthansa;4;27.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Washington;4;3;5;4;4;4;2;Flying frequently on Lufthansa on the transantlatic route and some Asian routes, this review is based on several dozen flights over the past few years. First the good:1. The aircraft and seats in business and economy are both are in good condition, even on the older 747-400s. The Airbus A380s and 747-8s are very good and definitely make for comfortable flying, given their ample storage space.2. The WiFi on board is reliable and good value for money.3. The pilots make an effort to keep passengers informed at all times, and the flight attendants are responsive. 4. The entertainment system has a wide selection of movies, and the food is of high quality, if not as adventurous as some of the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers.For areas with room for improvement:1. I have had three experiences in the last three years when my flights were cancelled due to strikes by pilots, cabin crew or ground staff in Germany. I don't know what the problem is (do they really get exploited by management or do they have a sense of entitlement

In summary:I flew from Ireland to Nigeria and back with Luftansa. Three of the four flights were perfectly satisfactory. Unfortunately on the last leg an incident occurred in which another passenger who arrived late onto an already full plane dropped their carryon suitcase on my head while trying to stuff it into the already full overhead lockers above my head and far from their own seat. I wasnt happy with the response of the crew and also had concerns regarding simple health and safety precautions that could have been taken to avoid a potentially very nasty incident. As it was, what happened and the indifference of the flight attendants left me annoyed, in physical pain and upset.Through sheer persistence and stubbornness and hours of ringing and holding I eventually found the right contact details for customer complaints in the UK. Over the following weeks I had 2 hour long conversations with very understanding but ultimately ineffective representatives. Both promised me that they write me a response, evidence of follow up and pay a small compensation for my time and upset. None of these have happened and i can only describe the whole response of Lufthansa crew and support staff to a potentially serious ~(but thankfully not so) incident to be very unsatisfactory. I certainly would not fly with them again!

Seats are good and comfortable - only when travelling alone the ""V-configuration"" of the business class seats gets you closer to the person seated next to you as you might want it to be... Service was good, but pretty standard ... they were just doing business. Food was great and the menu was suitable for every taste. Can't sy much about in-flight entertainment as I was sleeping most of the time but from what I saw the variety and quality was good. Only point that might deduct a point in rating is the price, LH is really above average here. Would still recommend travelling with LH and do it again."

Shame, Lufthansa.I fly a lot from TLV to FRA and no chance i will choose next time to fly business class with Lufthansa. No way."

I had even received a free upgrade to First Class and all I can say that it was a dream flight. I also prefer to fly with Lufthansa in Economy, when going on vacation, and always try to book their business class, when traveling on business. I noticed very significant difference in airfare when booking shortly before the date of my flights vs. securing my tickets way in advance. I paid almost $3,000 more buying tickets two weeks before my flight in January vs. the same flight in May. I am very impressed with the quality of their lounges in Frankfurt and Munich airports: welcoming service, sparkling clean, great food, perfect wi-fi connection. Non-smoking working space is very important for me, so I try to find a place to work further away from the smoking area of the lounges. Their First Class lounges are stellar - no flaws!Luckily, I have never encountered any delays flying with Lufthansa, but the growing frequency of air traffic controller strikes is very alarming.

My last three flights with Lufthansa just have not been the same, the service was less friendly, on two occasions the meal I had specially requested at booking and checkin was not there, despite having confirmed this before the flight. I switched carrier now, and had a pleasant experience. I'm quite tall, so leg room is often an issue for me which will explain the lower legroom score, I think they do offer better legroom than some competitiors.The service at the gate was efficient as it always is.I either choose Business or Premium economy depending on availability, and it even just doesn't seen as pristinely clean as before. Perhaps these occasions were just mistakes or but when it went to three in a row I had to change!

The flight was a breeze with a nice setting, a definitely well-trained staff and much better quality and presentation for the food. AND if you have kids....now they pamper our little stars so much that my daughter (who didn't like the company a bit) has become a fan now!That's definitely the way to go Lufthansa! As they say on the on-line magazine: they have been listening to their customers. We can see it!

I wasn't prepared for the PERSONAL cabin service. What a great idea to allocate one cabin attendant for each dozen or so passengers - and start the journey with a personal introduction. It's kind of like having your own butler!It was a 10 hour-plus flight, but certainly didn't feel like it. In fact, it seemed to be over too soon. I could have enjoyed another few hours of this level of service :)We will certainly be doing this upgrade againThanks Lufthansa
406377632;Lufthansa;5;16.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Singapore;4;5;5;4;4;4;4;We had seats in row 99 upstairs on the A380 - thinking we would be in a 2 seat aisle from what our travel agent said, but it was a 3 seat aisle - but the person next to us was very pleasant. The hostess picked up we were a bit confused and went out of her way to make us feel comfortable - which we were. She was especially good at her job. For a 12hr flight the A380 is fantastic.
406351187;Lufthansa;1;16.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;First Class;Frankfurt;New York;1;1;1;2;4;1;1;First of all, i must say that i used to travel very often with Lufthansa, actually almos once a month. For this trip i decided to treat myself with a First Class ticket, what a big mistake.My trip was on August 1st, which apparently was a big issue for Lufthansa.I will begin by the checkin at Nice airport as i was traveling from Nice to Frankfurt and then Frankfurt to New York.At check-in, the lady didn't seem to be quite interrested by the fact that as a First Class passenger you can get what they call the HON tags for your luggages. When i asked her if she could place them, she acted like if there was no difference, and i didn't need them. OkayAfter in the plane, i was told that in Frankfurt, a car will welcome me and take me to the next plane to avoid the hassle. What an excitment. Except that the car was not there, i went thru the entire airport, and when i asked for someone to tell me if there was a special passage for First Class, i was told that in Frankfurt, it is very difficult to accomodate First Class passenger. It's doable in Munich but not in Frankfurt. When i entered the Business Class passenger as there was no First Class lounge on the Z Floor for New York. I was told, there was a mistake, and the driver came to late to pick me up. Then, i said, okay, after 20 minutes walking thru the terminal, i just wanted a glass of water. The person at the front desk told me, that i was late for my flight, and that there was only 15 people missing, and that i couldn't stay in the lounge.I told her, then why no one came to pick me up and to bring me there, what advantage do i have to pay such an absurd amount of money for such a bad service (now i realize that it's not worthy to fly First Class with Lufthansa).But my surprise wasn't finished. At the gate, i was greeted by a purser who told me that the person who escorted me to the gate, told her that i missed the car taking me to the plane. I told her, how can i miss the car, i'm not the pilote of the plane.And i then asked her if i missed also the cleaning people as my seat was absolutely discusting. There was stains of coffee everywhere. Trash in the armrest, the seat smelled bad. The maitre de Cabine told me that they had a problem with the cleaning of the cabin and that they had to call them twice but apparently they didn't do it in First Class.No apologies, nothing, the flight attendant came and took away the trash, they didn't even clean up the seat, i had to use my anti bacterial wipes.Nothing was done properly and they were acting like if it was nothing and my fault if i was having a bad trip.When i arrived in New York i decided to complaint and to claim for a refund on that ticket as the food was served also in dirty plates, i'm sorry but when you pay over 8000 EUROS for an air ticket, you expect at least your seat to be cleaned. And to get some how a different service.I contacted customer service, but i didn't get any response. I decided to then email their CEO and customer service, and suddenly i received a response a week later.I was offered a refund of 300 Euros which is nothing compared to the air ticket price.Also, they pretended that the seat was cleaned in Frankfurt by the ground service. It wasn't true, it was done by me.When i told them, that i couldn't accept just a refund of 300 EUROS, i never get any other responses from them.I was stocked many times this past year when Lufthansa crew members were on strike, we were asked to understand and we didn't get any compensation for that. Here the issue, is that Lufthansa request an important amount of money for something where you don't get any special service, you don't even get a cleaned seat. Then, not only they do not respond to you, but they pretend nothing happened.It's as usual a one way situation, we must pay and when they fail they do not refund you, they just declare that nothing happened but exceptionally they will give you 300 EUROS, which represents not even 4% of the amount paid for that ticket.Lufthansa is dishonest. They are taking money and do not take responsibilities for their failures. Compare to the incredibly high amount of money my company and i spend with this airline. I was expecting a little bit more of consideration. Their planes are discusting, dirty, filthy and they pretend everything is fine.

The service was carried out efficiently, if not in an overly friendly manner.The plane had a recent upgrade that I found to be a bit clunky (table storage, headphone location). The comfort of the seat was very good, with a full recline for sleeping. The entertainment package was good, with a large screen and wide selection.All in all, it was a good flight

Meal consisted of a starter, hot main course and dessert. It was OK but nothing more, rather tasteless.

They keep coming around and offering drinks & snacks/food. Check-in is also very easy and fast and we a re amazed with the efficiency and friendliness of all Lufthansa employees. The choice of movies on board is also great. And the DIRECT flight from Frankfurt to Pune is great for us as we don't need to go to Mumbai and take a car from there onward.
405504069;Lufthansa;5;14.08.16;May 16;3;International;First Class;Frankfurt;Hong Kong;5;5;5;5;5;3;5;"Since over 40 years I love this airline, having traveled with my parents when I was a child, my log book with me and collecting signatures and stamps from the captains. Since about 20 years I am a very frequent traveler on Lufthansa, with between 500.000 - 1.000.000 miles per year constantly.I know that a lot of people including my colleagues swear on flying Asian airlines and find Lufthansa ""dull and lame"". I don't. Why is that? For me - flying that frequently - the thing that matters most is reliability and the ability to solve issues arising on my trips. The latter is the big advantage of Lufthansa - people working for Lufthansa can be (sometimes) a little stiff and unemotional, but they will find a solution for you (when you approach them right - ""complaining"" is never the best option on travel, regardless if airline, hotel or whatever other travel provider). That way I got back from the most remote points on this globe, when ""sh.. was literally hitting the fan"". Lufthansa did it.With the new First Class, and the new Business Class, the service in air is fine, not excellent, not super luxurious, but at a very high level and standard (and again: reliable). I have my own ritual of making the seat mine that probably will help you having an even better experience. In First: ask the hosts kindly to prepare your sear already before taking off with the mattress and let them give you the comfort sleeper and sleeper. That way you can cuddle and look outside when taking off. You just have to promise them to sit uprights while starting, otherwise they won't give those to you.Miles & More, the Lufthansa bonus program, is the best bonus program of all airlines or hotels in the world"

After the declaration at the airport, the company sent me a message to my handy, informing me about the details of my luggage. They told me which flight was my luggage load unto, so that I could foresee the probable time of its arrival at the destination airport. When it arrived, it was forwarded directly to my hotel's reception. I was happy that I could have my pajama before going to bed and my toothbrush after dinner on the same day of my arrival at destination.

Sat on the upper deck (84A) on the outbound flight. Compared to the A 380 I found the upper deck on the 747-8 was much less airy and you really felt like you were far removed from the rest of the aircraft. There are less passengers upstairs so I think the service was better. However, I ended up changing my seat assignment for the return trip to be on the lower deck. I will say that the 747-8 cabin seemed to be much quieter than the 747-400.

When you arrive to the FCT lounge the fun starts!Here your personal assistant and other lounge staff takes care of all your needs!In the FCT you can eat, drink (massive drink list) and relax. You have the opportunity to take a shower or bath before your flight which makes you very relaxed!The lounge act very professional and attention to details are high.I would recommend people to spend approx 5-6hrs in the lounge to make the most out of the benefit.Lounge staff picked me up approx 1hr before departure and they guided me through the FCT security, only me in line :). When we had cleared all the paper work they escorted me to the private limousine that would take me to my flight. When I arrived to the gate and entered the plane they First Class Cabin Crew welcomed me with a big smile and escorted me to my seat. In A380 First Class there are 8 seats.I started with a glass of champange as a pre-drink before departure.After departure the staff came by with a new drink, served a nice 3 course meal and served very nice wine.When I had finished my meal I had the cabin crew to make my bed and the rest is history since I slept like a king!I would recommend everyone to try the Lufthansa First Class experience.You will not be disappointed!Keep up the great work Lufthansa! ..I've already booked a new First Class trip with you

I usually fly economy for my ""short hops"" in Europe, and fly Business Class for the long haul trips to Asia and Africa. One thing I can say about Lufthansa that I can't say for other airlines is I don't feel a marked difference in service between the classes. Yes, I get excessive food and drink (and metal cutlery and glasses) in Business class, but I get fed and hydrated in Economy and - guess what - treated like a human being (and even spoiled by friendly flight attendants). I didn't think Lufthansa could improve on their amazing service until I traveled with a handicapped relative. We were discreetly pulled out of the check-in queue and received a special escort (with accompanying treatment) to the plane. Lots of people like to make snarky jokes about Germans with outdated historical allusions - make no mistake, the German National Carrier knows how to address the needs of its customers."

This could be improved!Seating was accomplished with friendly efficiency and I had an excellent seat with 52G.

The flight to LA was the shortest and a very comfortable one and flights are usually punctual in both directions. A pity the reward program is such a bad one (also compared with other Star Alliance members, e.g. United), where you basically do not get any flight without paying almost the full price of a flight for a cheaper airline PLUS the miles you have to spend.

Since my first flying days I got up a class or two and got some perks with my frequent flier card too, but that too has changed from what it used to be, even few years back.Don't get me wrong, this STILL IS one of the best companies around, but I still crave old Lufthansa.Crew is courteous and friendly, planes are super clean, movie selection is always up to date with recent hits (I know, I fly a lot), but food, unless you fly business class or first, has same flavor as other airlines.Upgraded coach seats are better, with addition of Premium economy that gives you more room, unless you sit in first/bulkhead row and you're my height (184) or taller. Than it's better to be in economy somewhere in the middle.Lufthansa lounges in Frankfurt and Munich are some of the best I've ever seen, but certain staff can be rude sometimes. Hey, everybody can have a bad day.And, maybe the most important part, they are safe and with some of the most professional pilots and technical crew I've ever met!All in all, still one of the best airlines, but others are picking up fast.

The flight due to take off the previous night was delayed so we were put up in a Hotel. Frankfurt does not allow flights to take off after 24.00.??? Must say the airline was very organized in sorting us out although we only got to the hotel at 1 in the morning - so well done to Lufthansa.The flight was in a new 747 and we were lucky to get the first row in Economy lots of leg room. Always enjoy the selection of entertainment always managed to find some thing to watch. Food is OK cannot complain as Airline food goes better that most.Like most of Lufthansa flights always very efficient and helpful no problems there. Frankfurt Airport a pleasure.Booking was fine all done on line as was seat selection and boarding. Web site easy to work with.A pleasant experience all round.
403479784;Lufthansa;2;09.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Pune;1;3;3;1;1;1;1;Worst experience ever. We started with flying from Toronto to Frankfurt by Air Canada and continue with Lufthansa. First we had outdated computer screens and super slow Internet WiFi service, food was horrible tasted like for sick peoples food. The only good thing was the staff where very helpful and caring. Seats were too small legroom and old fashioned. Reached Pune international airport and found out we check-in 3 bags and lost . At the airport they gave cash rightaway for lost baggage of 4,000 Rupees which you could hardly by so much for 1 days basic needs toiletries and clothes. Then received our bag after 2 days. They told us if we need more clothes before we got our baggage we can and they will reinforced the money just scan your recipe details at customer,relations@luftansa.com I did that and got postester failure sending notice.what's next don't know called them and keep on saying that's all the protocols

Just before christmas we read in the papers that LH discontinues flying to Kuala Lumpur directly in March and our departure date was end March. We called them and they told us that all passengers would be rebooked and informed after christmas. We could do the rebooking immediately though. We were rebooked via Singapore and on wiith Singapore Airlines - no other choice except for refund. We wanted specific seats in the first row of the compartment and were told we get them. Later I discovered that the seats were only booked on the way to, but not on the way back. It took quite a while and some efforts to get the seats also for the return flight. We were actually quite upset then we took the connecting flight in Singapore and saw that Singapore Airlines also offered Premium Economy on the sector SIN-KUL, but we were booked in Economy although we bought and paid Premium Economy with Lufthansa in the first place. The flight itself was good. The seats we chose were comfortable and we had a good flight and it was relatively quiet in the front cabin and not much running around. Food was ok as well. But there is no real consistency of the service, some things are served on porcelain and inbetween you get plastic cups etc. We liked the 2 armrests for each passengers.

Anyone that has the option to fly with them ought to. Food was excellent, cabin outstanding and lastly but not least crew unreal. When they go to the effort of calling you by name says a lot. I will definitely fly Lufthansa again.

At Barcelona, I was issued a boarding pass only till Frankfurt and not all the way till Mumbai. At Frankfurt, we were issued a boarding pass without a seat number. Later on we found out that majority of the people were not issued seat numbers. Lufthansa did a lucky draw for the seats at the gate. Ridiculous. Also, I had pre-booked a Hindu Vegetarian meal while buying tickets. I am extremely disappointed to say that I was only offered a non-vegetarian meal. As a result, I had to sit on an empty stomach for hours! Even more ridiculous!I will never recommend Lufthansa airlines to anybody. Pathetic service.

403122775;Lufthansa;3;09.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Denver;3;2;2;3;4;2;2;Unfortunately, servicewise Lufthansa performes only average. They announce pre-boarding at the gate, but don't control the class on the boarding pass. If you are seated in First or Business you have to wait in the first line to get first on the plane. Otherwise you are mixed with all economy class paxes. There's no separate boarding line for Business and First paxes. Onboard service and comfort are OK but average. The biggest advantage is their on-time and safety performance.
403091998;Lufthansa;1;09.08.16;May 16;3;Europe;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;London;2;1;;;2;;;We boarded along with approx 30-40 orthodox Jewish passengers. Despite repeated requests from cabin crew, these passengers refused to take their seats, wandering upstairs and downstairs and throughout the aisles, creating a 20 min delay in take off, making many people anxious about their connecting flights. This group wandered the plane throughout the flight, holding meetings and prayer meetings in the aisles, inadvertently blocking toilets and creating confusion and fear. They Òappeared to have complete control of the cabin, with the cabin crew seemingly giving up. A call from the captain was also ignored. Never have I been so afraid on a plane. Many missed their connecting flights, including us, so we were transferred to the next flight and assured our luggage would be transferred. Our luggage missed both planes.

402932345;Lufthansa;5;08.08.16;May 16;3;International;First Class;Frankfurt;Houston;5;5;5;5;5;3;5;This review covers the return flight from Frankfurt. This rating applies at the same level also for the outbound leg from Houston to Frankfurt.While you have to reach rather deep into your pocket to pay for First Class, there are frequently special fares available on the LH website, and American Express offers one additional passenger free when the full fare is paid for the first passenger. Thus, the actual cost is really not that outrageous if you do some home work .... anyway, it is a most enjoyable way to spend the kid's inheritance :-)!

On this Airbus 320, the business section has the same seats as economy, only with seat block in the middle. There is not enough space for overhead storage. A light meal with tuna sallad is served and the pudding is ""tiramisu"", which is quite tasty, but I would not call ""tiramisu"". The service from the cabin crew is professional. Arrival most or less on time despite some delay in departure."
402844296;Lufthansa;1;08.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Vancouver;;;;;;;;OK,, engine trouble I can understand. We sat on the plane for 3 hours while they tried to fix it. Didn't offer us anything. Finally, they ushered us off the plane where we waited another two hours. Gave us a 10 euro voucher for dinner, wow. Brought in another plane, sat on this one for two hours until we finally took off. Arrived 7 hours late. Had to get a hotel in Vancouver. Missed our connecting flight back to Maui. Had to buy a new ticket to Maui. I was supposed to be at work the next day. What did they say? Too bad, so sad, nothing we can do. No offer for even a free ticket or any reimbursement. Shocked!

However, compared to other airlines (e.g. Swiss, Singapore, Turkish, Emirates) it misses something on most dimensions. The seat is just slightly less well shaped, the meals are slightly less pleasant and service is slightly less than in my reference group. Still you pay the same, and get the ""pleasure"" of transferring in Frankfurt, an immense, poorly indicated airport where a transfer from one terminal to another can easily take 45-60 mins. I hope this helps travellers who have a choice, I hope this helps Lufthansa improve. I fly 100+ times a year."

The plane is small when it is fully packed! Once meal service starts, you can barely move around as no one can pass through. With three toilets on the plane, long lines begin to form! Lufthansa flew the larger planes on these routes and which they were always full, but decided to downsize but left the pricing as is. The crew is not happy, the passengers are not happy and complaints are made, but Lufthansa does nothing about it with an attitude ""take it or leave it""."

They great potential but misses the mark frequently the cabin crew vary but are not as personable as some airlines. The entertainment selection is seriously lacking on long haul flights and the food ranges from OK to poor. For short haul flights, Lufthansa can be cheap and efficient, long haul I would always opt for the better competitors if I have the chance-
402424544;Lufthansa;5;07.08.16;Aug 16;0;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Larnaca;;;;;;;;Flew Lufthansa to Larnaca in Cyprus. A much cheaper way to fly there rather than going with the likes of Jet 2 or Easyjet etc. Baggage included and arrive at 2:30 pm rather than in the middle of the night like you do with charter airlines. Perfect.

The maintenance of the aircraft is superb. In fact the 747 looks brand new. The in flight entertainment has a wide range of options. The Indian food is good. All in all they do live up to their advertising campaign of being a German airline with an Indian touch in everything. The crew are friendly and the service is efficient. I had no regrets for having paid for extra leg room in the bulkhead seats.

Service was friendly and professional.Seating on Lufthansa's short-medium range aircraft is adequate for a 2 hour flight unless you are over 6 feet tall. With my Star Alliance Gold status, I was able to reserve seats in the emergency exits which provided for a more comfortable flight, an additional piece of luggage and access to the Lufthansa lounges.I flew a few other European carriers that have are now charging for snacks and beverages. Lufthansa still serves complimentary beverages, including beer and wine and a snack. On all my longer flights was offered either a cheese or salami sandwich. I took advantage of the additional 23kg of luggage afforded to me as a Gold Star Alliance member (certain fares only) and the use of the lounges at all the airports. The Lufthansa owned lounges were excellent. I enjoyed the food and beverage options. After a long day of travel, it was also nice to have have access to showers in FRA and MUC. When traveling within Europe, I will continue to fly with Lufthansa. It's nice to have a glass of wine or a nice German beer!

The Kosher food was disgusting to say they least. Normally when asking for a specific food selection on other airlines, it means the main meal, but Lufthansa gives it to you for all meals. For example, Fruit menu is given for dinner & breakfast, and so is Kosher - both of which were tasteless, awful bland meals] Rather just have the standard meals if you can.

I'm pretty sure I've travelled all airlines that have direct flights between Europe and Seattle and Lufthansa has won me over. The airplanes are either new or completely renewed/modernised. They're equiped with the latest comfort and entertainment options.Service is very professional.The business lounge in Frankfurt has spatious private shower facilities to freshen up and be ready for business just as soon as you arrive at your destination.

The seat was definitely more comfortable and spacious and way much better legroom with foot rest option. Arm rest between passengers was wide enough to allow for both. Drinks were served in glass and cutlery was stainless steel. Travelling pack and bottled water were given. The service in the premium economy class is significantly different from the economy. If you do not mind to pay a bit more, this is highly recommended.

The Economy seat was slightly more roomy than other wide body aircraft I have been on. Would have been nice to have a foot rest if nothing else in ECY as the A380 is super long haul, feet get restless.Blanket and pillow provided. Plenty of customer service from the crew. After take off was a drinks service, wine and spirits were served from large bottles. Main meal was a good choice of food and descent quality. Plenty of more drink services throughout the flight and the galley areas were set up with a selection of juice and waters for you to help your self. A further light meal selection was served towards the end of the flight.In flight entertainment was good, not as good as some of the Middle East Airlines but still had a good selection of movies, TV and Radio.The crew offered Children's packs out after take off.Flight departed on time, service was good, no issues in flight, crew were helpful. All in all a good flight.My comments are for Frankfurt Airport - If you are transferring to connect to a flight you will need more than 2hrs, as the airport is huge.Would have no issues travelling again with Lufthansa

However over the years LH has lost its game because of too many cost cutting rounds imposed by the management. They lost the customer focus. Membership didn't mean anything anymore. The lounges and inflight service have deteriorated. So a couple of years ago I decided to spend my money with Emirates and Etihad. They provide much better value for money and they still honor their most frequent flyers.

Wish this airline would fly to many more destinations directly instead of sharing with airlines like United which is an instant downgradation.Would fly this airline as and where available.

The food is surprisingly good in economy, and the staff is so, so kind when I tell them I'm afraid, coming in to check on me and everything. Truly amazing. Plus, any flight that has hardly any turbulence is going to be a good flight in my eyes!
401712909;Lufthansa;5;05.08.16;Apr 16;4;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Panama City;5;5;4;5;5;4;5;Lufthansa long haul Business Class is the way to travel far. In Frankfurt boarding has own lane and bridge to aircraft. If you are wearing a suit, stewardess happily takes it to garderobe. After you have settled onto your seat, you can choose a welcome drink, champagne or non-alcoholic.Meal service is pleasure, first you have cocktail service, then you have several options as a appetiser and main course. I can really recommend fish, if flight is departing from Germany. The choice of wines really compliments the food. Desserts are nice, choice between sweet and salty and fresh fruits, usually you end up having all (don't tell anyone).In Business Class you get also an amenity kit with toothbrush, socks, earplugs and few other small items.Seat is full lie flat. IFE has latest movies, so remember also rest part of the flight. Lufthansa is one of the few airlines offering WiFi, though there is a fee, if you want to access outside LH provided sites.This particular aircraft is one of the oldest in LH fleet, but you don't notice it except in toilet.Business Class offers last important advantage is priority departure, enabling rushing to queue at immigration, as in Panama doesn't offer priority at immigration. Obviously your luggage arrives first with priority tags, but taxi queue goes faster than immigration, so advantage is just nice.Summary, flights over 8 hours Business Class is important, if you want to arrive fresh and exit quickly out of the airport.
401705061;Lufthansa;5;05.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;First Class;Frankfurt;Seoul;5;5;5;5;4;5;5;We flew from Frankfurt to Seoul in the first cabin of the Airbus A380.With Lufthansa crews you will experience both hits and misses (even in first class) but our flight, LH712 on the 16th of June, had an amazing crew.Arguably it didn't hurt that the only two passengers in the first cabin was my fiancÌ©e and I.The first class cabin on the A380 has only eight seats which makes it feel quite exclusive.It should be noted that Lufthansa in their A380s in the business class section makes use of a 2-2-2 seat configuration, which makes it feel very crowded. In comparison, Thai Airways use a 1-2-1 configuration in the same airplane in their business class. Hence I'd probably not chose Lufthansa for any business class flights in the A380.On the ground Lufthansa is simply the best, at least compared to other Star Alliance airlines. The first class lounges are truly that: first class.

It was a connecting flight with the Star alliance partner which had been delayed so when we arrived in Frankfurt we did not know if we could get the flight. An employer of Lufthansa welcomed us at the gate on arrival and told us if we hurry we can manage the flight. So running half of the old airport in Frankfurt we arrived to be told the flight is delayed by a staff member who found - as ones imagine - the situatino more funny than ourselves.

We were on a 2-4-2 seating arrangement and as a couple had the 2 which was more comfortable. Two meals were provided between Frankfurt and Tokyo and a good range of drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic were offered. My one major gripe was the flight was over an hour late to take off and whilst we stood in the terminal no announcement was made to keep us informed which is poor customer service.

We then went to the new gate, and after waiting for another 30 minutes, we noticed it had been changed to yet another gate- which was near to the original gate. The only problem was that the second gate was quite a walk away from the first gate. Do they think of older people who might not be so mobile and not able to change gates very quickly? SURELY AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL WOULD KNOW WHERE THEY WOULD PARK THE INCOMING FLIGHT? We were then delayed about 40 minutes due to bad weather over Belgium. The staff offered everyone a glass of water while waiting on the plane. Service was good during the flight.

You have Business Class seating and lots of space at a fraction of the price of Business class ticket.

There were also several radio programms you could hear up in the air.Lufthansa offered internet access for about 28 Euro. The internet did not work properly :-(In short: we felt very secure, we were happy with the service and enjoyed a nice flight.

If you fly a lot then you know of systerm of serving food.From front to the end of airplane. Last time when i fly on the end of airplane was group of German turist in middle of airplane was mix European, Asian and middle east people. On menu was fish and chicken. Of course cabin crew change system of serving food and start from the end of airplane. Of course reason was that nobody like fish in airplane and he know that first will be end of chicken and german turist must eat fish. For this reason that was my last flight with lufthansa. Bad expirence.

401404200;Lufthansa;4;04.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Hong Kong;4;3;5;3;3;3;2;First things first - it was not their fault that just when I had to fly to Hongkong the airport there was closed due to a typhoon.However - I did only find out about the typhoon on twitter and then contacted the airline also via twitter to see what's up - and they nonchalantly told me flight will be delayed contact customer services. Nice...That was about an hour before I had to leave to get to my connecting flight with them to Frankfurt. The helpdesk was at least - well - helpful and apologetic. They told me someone will be waiting for me at the gate (did not happen) and that I would get a hotel voucher to stay in Frankfurt as all other options are either full or also delayed (e.g. via Munich).So luggage checked through to Hongkong - boarding pass to Hongkong but alight in Frankfurt - nobody there to greet me (ok I am old enough to find a service desk) - go the service counter and they tell me go to another service counter in the departure area a mile or so away.. there one gets a number and waits, and waits... 1 hour - then the lady tells me here is your hotel voucher and a meal allowance of 20EUR - that hotel was the Intercity hotel and the shuttle buses leave downstairs... get down there and no info on how to contact the hotel for that shuttle bus tried to call them no answer until finally at 9.30 (that is 2.5 hours I got to the airport) the bus arrives and is immediately over full... to the hotel 15 min away.Got to the hotel and get a text message telling me then (what would have been 1 hour before departure) that my flight was delayed... a bit late by then..The hotel I will review elsewhere but lets just say Lufthansa could give them a bit of help - if they put more or less 300 people up in one place and tell all those people that they have to be at the airport again by 5..45 am they should also make sure there are enough buses to take that many people.... it was utter chaos and I felt for the busdriver who really tried his best...plus there where some large asian groups who wanted to stay together and by trying that blocked our departure for at least 10 min.Another delay at the airport so our 7am departure now turned into a 7.45 one Boarding - normally with planes this big one gets boarded by row number - not this one - they basically allowed everybody to go at once creating mayhem... not a good idea at all.Now to the planet itself - a A380 - and its huge - I was lucky my travel agent pre-reserved (at EUR25) a seat on the upper level on the side where there are only 2 seats - there are only about 5 rows of Economy on the upper level and I would highly recommend to use them. Seat was very spacious by comparison and rather comfortable. Entertainment again a big let down - not as many choices as I am used to.Service was great - we basically had our own Stewardess who looked very well after us. Food was a bit odd - no tray so that made it hard to keep things from falling off. Not much of a beverage choice either but I think one could have asked for things.Again at the other end as we landed in the middle of the night it seemed Hongkong Airport was not ready for us so we had to wait for a person to move the airbridge... for 10 minutes - unbelievable but not Lufthansa's fault. It took ages to disembark and even longer to get our luggage. I have flown with these big ones before (Emirates) but I feel that Lufthansa needs to improve on the passenger movement details when dealing with 500 odd passengers at once.
401400956;Lufthansa;5;04.08.16;Jul 16;1;Domestic;Business Class;Frankfurt;Hamburg;5;5;5;4;5;5;5;an absolutely very good flight as is usual with Lufthansa. The airplane departured on time, was clean and looked as new. The food was only a snak, the sparkling wine was good and the seats were confortable but not to much room legs, mainly because of the short flight.
401374117;Lufthansa;4;04.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Seattle;4;3;4;4;4;3;3;A good on time flight from Europe to USA.I have been flying on this route several times always in Business and the service depends very much by the crew on the flight. I had times that was fantastic a truly 10/10 and others that 5/10 was already too much.The flight was slightly late and in Seattle after Lufthansa lands several other airlines, that means congestion at the passport control, in addition being on Business class I was expecting to come out from the plane with priority, but it was not really the case.
401354636;Lufthansa;4;04.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Bogota;3;3;4;3;3;3;2;It is unusal that I fly long haul LH but reasons caused be to do so on this trip. The boarding experiance at FRA was below standard for such an airline. There was very little organisation from the LH team, with the result no-one really knew where to wait / queue etc. Boarding finally began (late) and as such they started boarding all classes at the same time leading to passengers queing in the jetway. Bad signage in the jetway meant that most passengers used the front (business) jetway rather than the second jetway, so business class was full of queuing economy passengers.The LH business seat is quite confortable except for the two seats in the centre (the config is 2/2/2). As the seats are angled towards the centre, the space for your feet is triangular and quite small. Also the legs of both passengers now become very close when in a sleeping pattern. If travelling alone, I would still recommend either a window seat or aisle seat on the pair of seats next to the window.Food was to the LH standard, which is good but below the standards of other airlines such as AF, KLM, Delta. On board service was good, but not exceptional. Toilets are some of the smallest I have found in a business cabin.

The crew was not son gentle but was fine, if you ask something, you will get it (after several minutes). The distance between seats was not enough for tall people (more than 1,81 mts like me). The price for the flight deserves less seats and more confortable, since you have to pay extra for a seat number!! (Iå«ve paid higher seat surcharge in first flight for extra leg room). Lufthansa Its far better airline than others, for sure (e.g. Iberia)."
401283638;Lufthansa;3;04.08.16;Sep 15;11;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;London;3;;4;1;;3;4;I hadn't flown with Lufthansa for many years - the previous time was a long-haul flight, and the experience was a good one. Therefore I was surprised to find that I wasn't happy this time. I can't criticise the flight and the handling of that itself, but when you operate a flight at dinnertime, I expect more than just a pathetic little bag with a snack. It just isn't good enough.
401266181;Lufthansa;4;04.08.16;Jan 16;7;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Delhi;5;5;5;4;4;5;5;I find Lufthansa to be one of the most reliable airlines I fly. It‰Ûªs German efficiency to get you to your destination ready to go.The A380 in Business Class has fantastic legroom, a great video/entertainment system and a flat-bed seat.The food and wine are good, although the standard is probably beaten by Air France or Singapore Airlines.Lufthansa are also Star Alliance members, making it easy to connect onto other alliance airlines or gain miles/status across the alliance.Lufthansa is a solid product. Still serving free drinks / snacks in Economy class within Europe, they haven‰Ûªt yet gone to that low cost model used by other European airlines.
401259678;Lufthansa;3;04.08.16;Feb 16;6;Europe;Business Class;Frankfurt;Madrid;2;3;3;2;2;3;3;Business class seats same as economy. Both are uncomfortable within Europe. Travel between north America and Europe- seats only recline 75% in a very strange configuration and it is even more uncomfortable than regular seats. Avoid Lufthansa if seats don't recline all the way---you will be better off on a different airline where the seats recline fully so you can at least get some sleep if you have paid for business class.

Adequate space on this 747 plane. Departure and arrival on time. Had to wait some 2 hours in B.A. for the bags, but this was due to a strike of the Airport personnel.
401257607;Lufthansa;4;04.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;London;2;4;4;3;1;4;5;On Frankfurt-London (vv.) you have a choice of BA and LH. Both are very safe, reliable and fairly punctual airlines. So actually you can't go wrong. However, I currently prefer Lufthansa for the following reasons:- Heathrow Terminal 2: Getting through T2, be it on arrival or for departures, is easy, efficient, quick. Lines are much shorter than in BA's T5 for example. Also there is a much better choice of airline lounges than in T5. - Frankfurt Terminal 1B: Most London flights in Frankfurt depart from Terminal 1B. I don't want to share my secret of how to get through security quickly as I fear that too many people would follow my strategy. However, please familiarize yourself with the terminal and find out how many security check options you have and which ones are the more obvious to most travelers and which ones aren't. Once you're airside there are not only LH but also AC lounges you can use.- In-flight service: While on BA in Economy class you get two very delicious but small cookies with your free beverage on Lufthansa you get one of those triangular sandwiches or a German bread roll with either ham or cheese. Service is equally friendly as on BA, seats are similar, too.
401253311;Lufthansa;4;04.08.16;May 16;3;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Johannesburg;3;4;3;3;4;4;4;Boarding went smoothly.For their long-haul flights to Johannesburg, Lufhansa makes use of the new Boeing 8I. Because we were just the two of us, we had booked a window seat at an additional cost in row 45. Most rows on the window side in economy are indeed for three. If you're only two it means that you are repeatedly disturbed on a long flight (or you have to bother someone else) if you want to go from your place.The inflight entertainment system and free onboard Wi-Fi are super. They have a wide choice of films and the Wi-Fi is fast and reliable.The food on board: well, you're not in a gourmet restaurant, especially not in economy. It's just food in a tray, not particularly tasty but certainly not bad. Yet, I've already eaten much better with some other companies.Neither I nor my wife is tall. In terms of legroom we rarely have a problem, but I can imagine that some people who are slightly larger do not know where they should stay with their legs. That problem, however, is in common with many other companies, because they try to squeeze as much people as possible in a small space to keep down the costs. An unfortunate evolution. On the intercontinental flights of Lufthansa you can take 23 kg of luggage. That is usually enough.The crew was friendly, helpful and correct without fringes, exactly as you would expect from the staff of a serious and respectable airline. Overall, it was a pleasant experience without frills and good in terms of price / quality.
401252936;Lufthansa;4;04.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Orlando;4;5;4;4;4;4;2;The flight itself was very good. Service also very good, and the food was also very good and I think better than most other airlines.What I think was somewhat negative was how boarding was organized and this problem is mostly the fault of the airport. The plane was completely booked out. There were so many people at the gate that it was hard to keep the boarding procedure moving smoothly. The Z gates at the Frankfurt airport are just not adequate for the number of people.
401235845;Lufthansa;5;04.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;San Francisco;5;5;5;4;4;3;4;I usually travel economy class but this time, I decided on flying Business Class as it was a long-haul (12 h) flight. A great experience indeed but I would say it was rather expensive for the service. The air-hostess were really nice and helpful. The flight departed on time and arrived 15 min late in San Francisco. This may be due to air-traffic congestion at the airport. The only bad thing about Lufthansa or Miles and More reward system is that, you need 30 flight or 30,000 miles to get an upgrade from the basic system which is weird. I don't think many people take 30 flights per year.
401230822;Lufthansa;3;04.08.16;Aug 16;0;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Birmingham;3;4;4;1;1;4;2;I like Lufthansa, but unfortunately they do not provide special diet snacks, such as gluten free, in this trip.They also did not announce the gate number until very late. Arriving from a long trip I just wanted to sit nearby the gate.
401229341;Lufthansa;4;04.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Delhi;4;5;5;4;4;4;5;I can see a few not-so-good reviews for Lufthansa already posted here. Well, I've flown LH enough to know that they are 'efficient' without too many frills. While I won't go into details of the cabin, seats, food etc. here, I would definitely like to call out that the efficiency and yes, warmth, of the crew makes for a very satisfying overall experience.This particular flight had me 'lose' my spectacles case to a recess in the seat (this is definitely a cause for complain!). Obviously, this is a frequent occurrence because at the start they announced if anything drops into your seat area, please let us know, else you may cause it permanent damage retrieving it on your own. Think mobile phones!!! Well, I reached out to the attendant our side of the cabin, Ms. Sabine Gosse Heteforth, who came across as really warm and helpful as she went about her work. She immediately came by and tried to search it out, to no avail. She came back again with another attendant, who obviously was an expert! And lo, and behold, my black case rested in a cavity under my seat.While this is to be generally expected, I think the effort and the attitude make all the difference and I have experienced this many a time on LH.Thanks LH and thanks Sabine!
401226195;Lufthansa;3;04.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Barcelona;3;3;3;3;3;3;4;The flight was so so with average standard.

Form Frankfurt to Boston, my last flight, I received special care from the chef-hostess and eat ok (well, on flights I cannot ever say I eat good food, and I always flight economy with every company I used). I recomend preferring this airline everytime there's the chance to have a flight with, for you specific destination. Also the airport staff in Germany (Frankfurt and Munich at least) is excellent (for a delay last time the cusomer service Lufthansa gave me ticket to eat, I relaxed in lounge, everything well organized).
401192110;Lufthansa;3;04.08.16;May 16;3;Europe;Business Class;Frankfurt;Florence;2;3;4;2;2;2;4;The seats are not great, neither is the leg-room in Business Class There's a weird system to block the seats so that only 1 person sits per row/side. If you travel as a couple, there's no way to sit together, even if both persons sit on the aisle side. The food is nothing special, but on short flights it's not that important I suppose. I saw no difference in the service between business and economy class. We got our flights with the Miles & More points and I would not pay the extra price for a short-haul European flight in this business class.

However, they are generally more expensive, and their service (in economy class) leaves a lot to be desired. They do advertize 99 euro tickets, but I haven't found any.In addition, even if you have elite status, you are still forced to pay for luggage (which other airlines don't do, like United Airlines for example). Also, even if you have elite status, you still pay for Economy Plus seating (they call it Premium Economy).It seems to me that they want you to pay
401151275;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;May 16;3;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Kuala Lumpur;4;5;5;3;4;5;5;This was our 3rd trip to KL with Lufthansa. As usual we book economy and then buy upgraded seats in the row after the bulkhead behind the premium economy class.This row has not only extra leg room but there is 1 seat less than other rows even the ones in premium economy. Better deal and better seats. Also we usually purchase our tickets 11 month prior to flight date. Not only do we normally get a better price, but in almost every instance Lufthansa is making one or even more changes to the exact departure time. When we phone the customer service office and talk to the Manager and complain, they provide us with free entrance to the business lounge which is a great benefit worth Euro 25 per person. Great place to relax if you have to wait for your connecting flight. Free Wi-Fi, free food and beverages.

We had two seats in the front of the upper deck. The crew was very kind and did take care of us very well. The food was okay, it was much better on the outgoing flight though.
401148047;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Seoul;3;4;5;4;5;4;5;Usually the LH experience is a very pleasant one, on time, friendly service, excellent safety record, but alas the seating space is not so convenient. I have the benefit of Senator status allowing me to pick exit row, but the average traveller is confined to less space. If I were a dog, animal transportation regulations would ask for more room to move.
401147536;Lufthansa;2;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Singapore;3;1;3;2;3;2;2;The reputation seems better than the service. Most time no menu choices though you are not sitting at the end of the rows. Unfriendly stewardesses. The electricity at my seat went off and was not working and steward wanted me to believe that this is a rotating issue in the airplane when there is an over demand. It was unbelievable as it happened to nobody else and as simple as it was only the middle section of our row. As I tried to ask somebody else about the issue, I was rudely interrupted from behind, that I discussed the issue also prior with this person. Nothing happened for the remaining 5 hours of the flight about the electricity what stopped me from using my laptop. Even on long flights there is only main meals and no snacks. So you are lost when you skip a meal on basis of adjusting to time difference.

The flight attendants gave most of their attention to these people, as I imagine no one wants a crying baby on a plane. The row in front of me reclined their seats a soon as they could and the flight attendant ignored my request to ask them to get out of my lap. I also had to call a number of times for services and at one point during the night rang and had the attendant walk past and turn off my call light while ignoring me. I barely got any rest at all.The plane was a Boeing Dreamliner and thankfully I had an adapter since they are fitted with aeroplane headphone jacks and the headphones provided were very budget.

I am willed to pay extra if I have the choise between KLM, Iberia, Air Canada, etc. and Lufthansa. You know it's gonna work, you know if not, they help you and you know that the service level is at least decent. So normally, no bad surprises with Lufthansa.

The reputation of Lufthansa on this point is good.For the rest, even in business, where the tickets are really expensive, you will not find very good food, just typical international food preparated by german people ... (I am french) and the service is ok but not exceptionnal, polite, but very cold, nothing to compara with Emirates for example. Hope they will change that ...

But once my future flight was cancelled and I received a mail from Luft which looked like a booking confirmation BUT there was a box with ""Your flight has been cancelled..."" in the top. The text was rather imperceptible and I didn't notice it from the first time. Thanks God my husband noticed it and we rebooked our flight within 14 days term for free. I don't think that this is a good idea of notice taking into account that Lufthansa could send sms. Seats are not comfortable on short-haul flights."

Some of my fellow travelers commented on the small aircraft, but actually I have to admit that the space in the aircraft was more enough. And having only two seats on each side of the aisle is in my opinion much better.The inflight snack was ok.Overall the whole trip was very punctual and without any reason for complaints.Sitting on the right side (with usual approach), one has a wonderful view of the historic city center of Poznan.
401129206;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Sep 15;11;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Sao Paulo;5;5;5;4;5;5;5;Amaizing service, very nice flight attendants, very wide comfortable seats with enough space for your belongings and your feet, food is also totally fine, I liked small pillows and blankets, perfect variety of movies, music, tv shows in your personal tv (different languages and both very new and classical movies). This was probably the most comfortable long flight in the economy class that I had.
401127127;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Denver;4;5;4;5;5;4;4;On time service. Clean seats, bathrooms, cabins. Personable flight attendants who treat you well.

401126185;Lufthansa;3;03.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Delhi;3;2;5;4;2;3;5;"Flying on Lufthansa's A380 Business Class service to India was something I was looking forward to. I sat in row 10, Seat G, and the bulkhead was in front of me. You are also close to the kitchen area and bathrooms so noise from that is going to be a factor if you are planning to rest. So will the constant traffic up and down the aisle as this bounces your chair. The food was good and the offerings were not lacking. The seat is awkward in its adjustment (and basically you can't seem to get into the right position with it's limited adjustment, but it does lie flat. Tall people are going to have a problem as your feet end up in a compartment. The entertainment offerings are great, however the internet was terrible and rarely worked. The largest disappointment, however, was the service. I had to get out of my seat more than once to go into the kitchen to get a Diet Coke. Both times the flight attendants looked ""put out"" for having to stop their conversation to assist. I felt awkward to even ask. Once I rang my call button but no one ever came. I left feeling like the passengers were an inconvenience/nuisance to flight attendant crew who were just getting their job done and enduring the passengers. So I would describe the service as efficient, but cold bordering on rude."

On the return Frankfurt to Hong Kong leg we had a last minute opportunity to upgrade to Premium Economy. For the long haul it was worth the extra - more room, good service, better toilet access - same Economy Food though. Big Airbus was really quiet compared to flights in other planes. Travelling with a mobility disability - well looked after, thank you.

This is the very first time I was impressed by an airline's economy service! I truly felt I was getting first class service at an ""economy price""!! Yes! I have flown ""first class"" on many occasions. As such-- this is Lufthansa economy-----All the soft and hard drinks you want! Ceramic plates, stainless silverware, amazing real food, awesome attentive service!! No extra charge!!Why pay more for first class?? If you are traveling on Lufthansa internationally, economy is ""first class at a quarter of the price of first class""!! O.K the seats are smaller! So what!!!, the price is right!!! A must try!!!"
401087456;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Denver;5;5;4;4;5;4;2;We flew Lufthansa out of Frankfort - a completely full flight. Each seat had a TV with free movies. A snack and two meal services. Drinks were free. Great legroom in Premium Economy. Regular rounds with glasses of water or orange juice. Pleasant helpful service. Did I mention the drinks were free?But make sure you are actually flying Lufthansa. Since it partners with United, many times the flights are actually United - with snotty United crew, lousy food, pay TV, pay drinks, pay, pay, pay....I suspect this is what some reviewers have experienced. We found the crew to be sweet and accommodating (They brought me ear plugs because of a crying baby a few seats away.) The only criticism is that the boarding was somewhat of a free-for-all.
401087285;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Seattle;5;5;5;4;4;4;5;The flight was operated in a 747-400 in upper deck business class. The seats are all state-of-the-art sleeper seats with enough personal space. If you are sitting in an aisle trow, the window seat person will however need to disturb you to get out of his seat. The food selection and quality was good, even Espresso has now been added to the hot beverages (not sure why this took so long). The selection of films included many movies that are still shown in the theaters and ranges from action to kids formats. The flight was ontime and the crew was, like always, very kind and thoughtful.

The cabin is small, so there is less movement and noise. The seats are comfortable and go fully flat, but they are somewhat narrow. Due to the angle of the seats, two tall passengers may occasionally touch feet.Food was good, but not memorable. IFE was OK but not great.I found the hard product slightly better than Swiss, but Swiss wins on service and food.

The jet was a A340-300 and I sat in row 6. The seat had more recline that regular economy, there was an adjustable foot rest (attached to the seat in front of you), a large (17 inch) screen with a wide variety of movies, TV shows, music, and more. The entertainment system allows you to use your own head set and has a USB port to charge your devices. We were offered a beverage upon boarding and the meal was better than most I've had in economy. We were even given a small comfort pack with toothbrush, socks, sleep mask. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful.

They may not have some of the posh perks and glam of some of their Middle Eastern competitors, but you can count on getting consistent quality service. Checkin: This was done using LH's automated kiosks at Frankfurt airport. No issues here.Boarding: Traveling with my son, we were invited to be among the first to board - doesn't get much smoother.Service: This is where I was particularly pleasantly surprised. I have flown LH many times before, and it was a bit hit or miss when it comes to the flight attendants' service. This flight was different, and the service was on par with the likes of Singapore Airlines or Emirates. Cheerful and helpful flight attendants did what they could to keep the passengers happy. And happy we were. The food was plentiful and good. The kid's meals, in particular, were a big success.Comfort: What LH offers is what I'd call standard economy fare (although much better than what I'm used to on US carriers). That said, the legroom was adequate, the entertainment system was good, and the cabin (and bathrooms!) was kept clean throughout the flight.Oh, and we arrived back in DFW a few minutes early. Well done Lufthansa! We'll be back!

The Lufthansa A 380 interior takes the prize. It is contemporary design at its very best all the way down to the toilets. Boarding was efficient and painless, the seats were extremely comfortable and the entertainment offered a wide selection. Unfortunately one TV programme I would like to have watched was German language only. The food served was uninspiring to say the least and once the meal and drinks service ended on this overnight flight, the cabin crew disappeared and service ended full stop.......a big contrast with their Star Alliance partner Singapore Airlines on our next leg from Singapore to Sydney as Lufthansa does not operate that sector.

The seat configuration on the A380 avoids the 'footsie' problem with your neighbor so that was an improvement over a flight earlier in the year on their A340. On the other hand, they don't do anything special with the A380 so you could be flying on any plane and that's a missed opportunity. However the crew is super friendly and that makes a difference. The food was very good. The seat very comfortable. So like I said a very solid business class product in a very competitive environment.And let's be honest, when one is lucky enough for whatever reason to be able to fly business class it's hard to complain or be anything but happy and grateful.

The seat are very comfortable and are much like domestic US carrier first class seats that do not lie flat but have a significant recline and are very spacious. The amenity kit was great. Water bottles at the seat. Before I took the flight, I read about the PE seats not being separate from the economy seats and in fact were bewteen two sections of economy. Others have said it felt odd. I felt like the sections were separated enough that it did not seem like a huge issue. Food service was great. Would highly recommend this if you have the chance to try it.

The treatment we received was more than accommodating and the female Lufthansa employee that tried to re-book us gave her absolute best. First Class on an A380 has only 8 open suites in a 1-2-1 configuration on the upper deck, including your own full size lit locker for your coat and carry on!! The food, drinks and staff were above my expectations, full size lie-flat seat with massage options, plenty of room and power outlets for all accessories you may brought on a flight. Real pillows and comforters and if you like a bathrobe. There are two large bathrooms on each side at the front of the plane, with plenty of room and toiletries to choose from, even a vase with a fresh flower. All in all 5 stars.
401008054;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;May 16;3;International;First Class;Frankfurt;Los Angeles;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;We try to fly in Business class on long international flights so I search long and hard for the best deals. This time I struck the jackpot when I spotted a first class fare for only $50 more pp over Business. WOW! There IS a distinct difference in the class of service. We only had 7 passengers in our 8 passenger cabin. For the first time, we even had a slightly larger (private) lavatory that was decorated in lighter, nicer colors. We had two flight attendants who were excellent and seemed to know what we wanted or needed before we did! The purser came around to greet each of us and at the end of the flight to personally thank us for flying with Lufthansa. The food service was done very nicely but the food on Turkish Air still wins the 1st prize in excellence. The seat had so many buttons I don't think I ever figured them out but I certainly was comfortable. The extra thick mattress pad that was placed on the fully reclined bed seat and full sized pillow were fabulous. This was one of those flights when you wish it was longer! How often has that happened to you? Upon landing, we have Global Priority so get through all the red tape lines very quickly. Even so, our bags were just coming off the belt at the airport (FIRST!) so they handled the bags very efficiently, too. With all of this said, yes, we realize how fortunate we are to be able to experience this class of service. Everyone has their priorities and comfort and convenience while traveling is very important to us as senior travelers. We aren't as particular about our hotels as long as they are in a good location and clean. This time we were also very lucky to find this very special fare. I forgot the pre-flight perks! The lounges are wonderful! We had such a short connection that we couldn't experience the First a Class lounge in Frankfurt which we understand is awesome. They even drive passengers to the plane via Mercedes in some cases. Now THAT is what I call class!
401005475;Lufthansa;2;03.08.16;Jun 16;2;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Stockholm;3;1;3;2;2;2;1;Air Canada's Star Alliance Partner, Lufthansa, new we were coming, they only allowed 90 minutes to travel from a landing place far from the terminal. Had to travel to the terminal by bus - very slow ! Then go through all the security and customs. No little shuttles in the airport (not like Toronto where there were lots of them). No effort by Lufthansa to speed up our lengthy trip through the terminal where one has to take elevators or escalators up an down a couple of times. To cap off this experience Lufthansa did NOT rebook us on the next flight - the took us out of the system so our leader had to rebook us one by one.

400996091;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Los Angeles;;;;;;;;Fairly comfortable seating (much better than Norweigen and Swiss which I have flown this year), tasty food, good movie selections with padded earphones, attentive service (offered water and snacks throughout long flight) and on time!,
400993853;Lufthansa;3;03.08.16;Oct 15;10;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Lisbon;;;;;;;;We had connected flights (also LH), and the luggage was delayed. We arrived at 21h at Lisbon, and we were told that our luggage will be delivered at our hotel during that night. My wife and me were lucky and got our stuff next morning. Four days later we met a lady from the same flight buying wardrobe since she still didn't get hers. After about two months after applying for refund of expenses we had (for cosmetics etc) I got credit on my account.

However these aircraft have been refurbished to reflect the interior of the 747-8 and are really quite nice. Many airlines' 747s are pretty tired but LH has done a really nice job. The aircraft interiors are brand new. Seats are very comfortable, I am a tad over 6'3"" and 235 lbs and fit just fine.Service was prompt and very friendly. The Purser was a constant presence reviewing and assisting service. Meals were good but not excellent as was the beverage selection. The overall flight experience was very pleasant and comfortable as was the Senator Lounge at FRA. The Lounge used for LH in SEA can only be described as really lousy."
400990522;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Sep 15;11;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Los Angeles;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;The best economy flight I have ever taken. It felt more like premium economy, or even business class on domestic flights. The attention to detail and passenger treatment was outstanding. Given the choice, I would take this airline over any other when traveling to and from Europe.
400989285;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;London;5;5;;;;4;;I had a great time flying to UK with my family. There's a special check-in area for families at the airport which is quite convenient when having small children. On both planes (back and forth) the staff gave them small souvenirs suitable for them.I would fly again any time.
400985407;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Rio de Janeiro;4;3;4;5;2;3;4;"Processes are thoroughly optimized, but overall experience very much depends on the flight attendant's ""form of the day"". This time it was good and, additionally, the food was excellent (on the return flight GIG-FRA a similar pasta was a disaster). Entertainment options are poor (too many American B-movies) and internet is only available at extra cost."
400981998;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Dec 15;8;International;First Class;Frankfurt;Toronto;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;We decided as it was Christmas time to give ourselves a treat!The treat started at the airport Senator first class lounge. Here we had Lunch with drinks of your choice. One is personally escourted from the Lounge to the aircraft before departure.Our seats on the upper deck consisted of a couch-reclining seat plus a complete bed next to the couch seat.A grand champagne Louis Roederer was served with tit bits before departure. The flight attendent filled our glass as soon as it was empty. The menu served from Caviar with a 4 choice Starter and a 4 choice main dish with a variety of white and red wines- Service was excellent and one is pampered during the whole flight, even tucked cosily into bed.Never before did we enjoy such attention- Thanks LUFTHANSA
400976829;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Hong Kong;3;4;4;4;4;4;4;As our flight originated elsewhere we had to change flights at Frankfurt Airport. The geography of the airport is always a puzzle to us and so we opted not to go for the (under two hour) transit time recommended but to go for the 7 hour one instead which was probably as well due to security checks. A nice member of ground staff let us board with the business and first class so we got to our seats quickly. The flight itself was very comfortable with Lufthansa A380 configuration placing Premium Economy forward of the wings and most of the engine noise. Food was a pleasant beef stew with rice. Entertainment featured nearly 5 hours of 19th Century Wyoming western films (H8ful Eight and The Revenent) as well as 'My Name is Doris' (on the other end of the spectrum) and a rake of other stuff (highlights of football classics between Bundesliga clubs also featured on my son's screen). Sleep eluded us on this leg for some reason and breakfast only arrived after a very long night. A very flavoursome dish of scrambled eggs with spinach featured with a yoghurt for afters. Coffee was, as expected from a German carrier, very good. Baggage claim on the other side was a bit slow, unfortunately, but not necessarily Lufthansa's fault. Would fly again with this airline this destination over Virgin's Premium Economy anyhow.
400975419;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Denver;3;5;4;5;3;3;5;I like Lufthansa service and comfort. They actually served two meals on this international flight, and included little extras like after dinner coffee or tea, and warm damp finger towels before the meal. The only thing I didn't like was a 300 euro charge to change my flight. I considered it an outrageous charge for a change that occurred long after the originating flight and far in advance of the return flight. They had plenty of time to fill my seat.
400970951;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Seattle;5;5;5;5;5;4;3;I recently returned from Saudi Arabia, with routing through Frankfurt on Lufthansa. I'm going to start this by saying I've flown US Domestic carriers a bit, and noticed that economy class is VERY cramped. I've also flown on the same US Domestic carriers in Economy Plus, or whatever they call it particular to their airline (United, Delta specifically). There is a big difference between Economy Plus and regular economy with United and Delta. So, carrying on from there, Lufthansa Economy is like United or Delta Economy PLUS. The 4 extra inches of legroom is the biggest thing to me. I've had better experiences as a whole with Lufthansa crew and in cabin services than with United or Delta, but it has been a long time since I flew on Delta. The food is well, airline food, but United service barely includes snacks lately. You get a drink and that's about it, unless things have changed since I flew last. I have to say though, I've only flown wide body Lufthansa flights. I have no idea about smaller aircraft. Now this last flight was overbooked. Had I not needed to get home would have taken advantage of the offer to give up my seat for a voucher and 600 Euro cash. One thing about a flight being overbooked though, is usually if there are any open upper class cabin seats a Star Alliance Gold member will get moved up to make room for an economy seat. Which I was thrilled to get moved up. So, I got to sit in Premium economy. Which has more legroom, you don't have to fight for the armrest, a little bit nicer service, overall more comfortable experience than economy.  I have to reiterate though, if I had a choice between Lufthansa, United, or Delta economy seat, I would choose Lufthansa every time. I can't stand how cramped the economy seats are in United or Delta.
400967652;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Business Class;Frankfurt;Edinburgh;5;5;5;5;;5;5;Well I enjoyed this trip from start to finish. The Purser was great. Nothing was too much trouble. Sit back and relax. Food was good. A very nice wine. I was sorry to get off in Edinburgh. The only thing that was wrong was that the luggage took so long to arrive but that was not the fault of Lufthansa.
400959292;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Sao Paulo;5;5;4;5;5;4;5;Best airlines from Europe to SÌ£o Paulo. Second best is BA. LH has the best airplanes, most modern, great service, best lounges. If you fly first class, then, you will have the best of the world service.
400957696;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Birmingham;4;4;4;4;4;4;4;Very good experience - decent seats, pleasant and polite staff and good food. Didn't expect anything on the 1 1/2 hour flight but got a sandwich on the return flight.
400950196;Lufthansa;3;03.08.16;Feb 16;6;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Singapore;3;3;4;4;5;3;5;First time on the big bird...although in economy we managed to get seats in the upper deck which had a 2\4\2 configuration. The seats are at the very back of the aircraft and the turbulence was horrendous not so much the up and down turbulence you normally get but side to side as we were directly under the tail....as a frequent flyer I am used to some turbulence but this was ridiculous and I was sick 3 times .not good on a 13hr flight. The return we sat downstairs and no bother at all.. best advice sit downstairs even though you don't get the same amount of space
400948499;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Sep 15;11;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Porto;4;;;;4;;;The check-in process at Frankfurt airport is very efficient and fast. Lufthansa's ground attendants are attentive and helpful and everything runs smoothly. The on board attendants are also friendly and helpful. The flight quality is above average and I have been lucky for arriving on time (favourable winds, probably!). I recommend Lufthansa as an option for flying abroad.

400940002;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Sep 15;11;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Toronto;3;4;3;4;3;3;3;Service was efficient and one flight attendant in particular really seemed to care about the well being of the passengers. In hindsight, I wish that I had asked her name.
400937897;Lufthansa;3;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Boston;3;3;4;3;4;3;4;We flew from Boston to Munich to Vienna then returned from Prague to Frankfut to Boston. The first 3 flights were uneventful, long, but the way it is. The flight from Frankfurt to Boston was uneventful airwise but the man in front of me twice violently returned his seat to the full upright position. He used his left arm to grab the back of the seat. Unfortunately my tray was down with a drink on it. My right arm was resting on the tray. My tray flew forward, the drink spilled, and the skin on my arm peeled a bit. No blood though. The flaw is in the tray is designed: where a person can inadvertently grab the tray mechanism rather than the back of their seat. Lufthansa/United may not be different in this regard from other airlines. The final snack was not very good either.
400937892;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;New York;;;;;;;;All services were very professional, nice crew, good food. Highly recommend Lufthansa, their name continue to be respected.
400936888;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Nov 15;9;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Miami;3;5;4;4;5;4;1;I like this company, but I had some bad experience in the past where I spent 11 hours in the airport as the security was on strike. This time it felt like I was close to catch another one and I just made it through the check-in! Other than that, I like the food, entertainment and the service.
400935412;Lufthansa;1;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Buenos Aires;4;2;3;3;4;3;1;We boarded an already delayed flight on the 22nd July at Frankfurt for Buenos Aires,there had been delays due to storm and fork lightening and ground staff not working in those conditions which was fair enough, we spent nearly 3 hours on the ground waiting to take off,we were informed they had missed the curfew for take offs and our flight would not be leaving and we taxied back to the terminal, at no stage was any information given by crew as to what we needed to do once we disembarked, we were left stranded at Frankfurt with 2 children. The whole airport was full of passengers in the same situation, and no ground staff visible to help or give advice. It was absolute mayhem, it wasn't until 3 pm the following afternoon when checking in for our delayed flight my husband found a leaflet on the desk with info on what to do when your flight is delayed.shocking lack of information, and staff, there were many irate and distressed people.
400934219;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Sep 15;11;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Mexico City;4;5;5;4;4;4;5;This was one of many flights I had with Lufthansa and the first (and only so far) with a brand new Boeing 747-8I. The flight was comfortable, even in plain Economy seating, with on board entertainment (talking about watching 4 movies back to back), decent meals and friendly staff. It was quite enjoyable, definitely moreso than their short haul flights.
400932560;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Riyadh;4;4;4;4;3;5;4;The normal Airbus A330-300 was swapped for an A340 for this flight, eliminating the first class cabin, and shrinking the business class cabin dramatically. The seats are such that my seat mate in the middle section (2-2-2 configuration) as he slept was able to stick his feet into the cubby area where my feet were to go.That said, the service was decent, the food was ok, and the flight was quite uneventful (always the best kind!).
400930086;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Apr 16;4;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Singapore;4;4;5;5;4;4;5;Lufthansa has 6 seats in business class (Singapore airlines has 4 seats), means the seats are a bit narrower. However, there is still plenty of room and a full flat bed in Lufthansa. During my travel Singapore Airlines was even a bit cheaper than Lufthansa.
400929959;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Aug 16;0;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Seattle;4;5;5;4;5;4;5;Paid for Premium Economy, sat in another bulkhead. Everything went well, flew during the day. No jell lag this way, just really tired. Places to wait in Frankfurt. Farther gate, biggest plane of the day. Passengers 1/2 American and 1/2 European. Passports at SEA took over an hour, longer than anywhere in Europe and not as polite. Food okay, generous with wine, beer and spirits. Seat bigger, tons of legroom and great entertainment. USB plug on the video screen. Really nice trays.
400929708;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Chicago;4;5;5;4;5;4;5;Very good service, food okay, excellent entertainment packaged. New seats okay not as comfortable as old but they do recline nicely to near flat.
400929437;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jun 16;2;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Philadelphia;4;5;4;5;3;4;4;This was a round trip flight and my first time in the Premium Economy class. Definitely a big step up from economy. You get bigger seats, more leg room, two free suitcases, choice of meals, free drinks and great service, And you get that German precision where the flights were exactly on time. All in all, great.
400927379;Lufthansa;3;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Singapore;4;3;5;3;5;4;5;The flight leaves Frankfurt at about 10pm (if on schedule). In our case, there was a 2-hour delay because of a thunderstorm - things happen. On a positive side, the airline was very informative during the waiting time and did their best when the airport resumed operations. A big plus: the very quiet A380. I admire the plane for its soundproofing. Even seating next to the turbines, one hardly hears the outside noise.What I fail to comprehend is - why serve dinner at midnight (or in our case, past that time)? It would make much more sense in just offering light snack/dring to those still awake and serving a solid breakfast a few hours later. Because it was an overnight flight, the 12.5 hours went by rather quickly (although I do not really sleep onboard). And we missed our connecting flight in Singapore because of the late start, but were rebooked on a later flight - so, no complaints here (especially, at Changi - there are quite a few options for spending some time between the flights).
400926686;Lufthansa;5;03.08.16;Jul 16;1;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Tallinn;4;5;5;5;1;5;5;Despite delays in FRA that were no fault of the airline - first no stairs for the cleaners(!), then a plane parked behind ours - Lufthansa was able to make up most of the time and get us to Tallinn on time. The pilot was very communicative and positive. Nice to see an airline that still has a few frills - drink and sandwich, free newspapers at the gate, little puzzles/toys for young travellers.A tip: It is normally only possible to check-in 23 hours before the flight online. I found the Lufthansa app (iPhone) allowed me to check in about an hour earlier than that. Important when you booked Economy Light and you have no reserved seat.
400925969;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;Jun 16;2;Europe;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Gothenborg;4;4;5;2;2;3;5;On time, not overcrowded. Very adequate legroom. Pleasant non obtrusive staff. The sandwich served on board was below par. No entertainment is available on these short-haul flights, but listening to an audio book with standard closed headphones was ok as the general sound level on this Airbus 320 was rather low,

Premium Eco is how Eco should be and was many years ago. Enough room, a bottle of water and a small kitt with some treats.Flying is so cheap nowadays, that Premium Eco at Lufthansa is definitely worth the extra price.
400924750;Lufthansa;4;03.08.16;May 16;3;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Rome;4;4;4;4;4;3;4;"Lufthansa is a very good airline and we fly it whenever we can. But....with all the legacy airlines trying to compete with discount carriers one needs to watch for baggage fees. We discovered this on a recent LH flight when we had to pay 60 euros for our two bags because our travel agent had apparently booked us on ""Economy Light"" instead of ""Economy"". Economy Light means only a carry-on can go for free. Not really Lufthansa's fault but be sure you know what category you're booking at the get-go."

Lovely service and good meal along the way.We flew there in premium economy and decided to come back in business class since it was a long flight and we wanted to sleep. Lovely vacation. I never have the opportunity to fly Lufthansa much, but when it pops up on expedia, I always look at it. I had a nice experience with them.

The airplane experience however, can be improved. To start off, the stewardesses were all tense during the flight? I had to calm one of them down and apologize to her if I had caused her any stress. She loosened up a little after that. Onboard service was ok, but not stellar. Seat comfort was below acceptable level. 17.5 seats are not good enough for a 178cm, 230 pound person like me. It was not a comfortable flight by any stretch of imagination. cross Atlantic seats must be 18 inches minimum. Other than that, Lufthansa is a good solid airline. Will I fly with them again? Remains to be seen.

Unfortunately, we experienced a delay because not enough water was loaded onto the plane. This in turn led to us losing our slot and having flight control in Brussels push us back even further. I think we left over an hour late. But the crew on the upper deck made life very comfortable with excellent service. While heading down the eastern seaboard we were informed that we may be diverted to Pittsburgh due to weather in Washington. Thank our lucky starts we finally made it in almost two hours late, but at our destination and unscathed from the storms.So even with 11 hours on the plane, it was still a great experience. Good food, a good wine (the Austrian red was horrible) and an enjoyable crew.

I really couldn't fault anything about the experience and would definitely fly Lufthansa again, and hope to do so very soon.

I can't say enough about the wonderful service and good food we had on this flight. A second round of warm wet cloths were distributed after the meal as well. I would absolutely recommend this airline highly to anyone flying to/from Europe.

The flight was on a 747, which I had never actually been on. Great plane. Too bad they're not going to keep making them. The food was very good and the flight attendants were very professional. The wine selection was somewhat limited, but that's a minor complaint. The number of movies and tv shows available on their entertainment system is very extensive and there are even games for the kids. This flight takes the polar route and it was a gorgeous clear day which allowed us to see this region of the world. Icebergs, massive ice sheets, and huge inlets made for fascinating viewing.

So, I went to front desk and ask about it. Yes ""security"" was calling me urgent ! In the same time that every one was boarding plane.Once in ""security personnel Office"" one of them, show me a Luggage at 50 feet far from me, alone in the middle of a corridor, and ask ( or shout) if it was mine ? I answer that yes, because it was of my property. One second , and I was ""move"" to a closed room, where a ""security specialist"" shout or squawk in my face, I didn't know what about,because he spelled in German, and was really crazy. I told him to speak in English, but it was and impossible situation. At this time this ""specialist"", was out of his mind. So do I ! Luckily in that ""impact moment"" a lady from my back, order him to go out. Then in a polite procedure, she ask me about my belongings, and what was into that very suspicious package, ordering me to open it and showing her everything into it.During procedure and interrogation, I found a bell from Grassmayr-Tirol,Innsbruck. That was the ""HAZARD"". The intelligence lady take a breathe!! I need to order all one more time ,and plane in gate waiting for me.Time has change hazards, and every one is suspicious, and people not well trained to manage situations are the real hazard combo. But one thing is positive or should be: Don't underestimate unprofessional attitude from nervous people. They are just working for your security. And Frankfurt airport has his black background."
400308667;Lufthansa;1;02.08.16;Jul 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Miami;1;1;3;2;3;3;1;A couple of weeks ago, my wife and I flew on Lufthansa flight 1051 from Paris CDG to Frankfurt and on flight 462 from Frankfurt to Miami. We both had small rollaboard cases and my wife had a small bag as well. When my wife scanned her boarding pass, a red light went on and a Lufthansa agent ordered her to step aside. I scanned my card and the light turned green for me. I went to check on my wife and the agent ordered me to stand with my wife because, she claimed, my rollaboard case was ‰ÛÏtoo bulky.‰Û I tried to explain that I had put my laptop and its case inside to consolidate everything and I could remove it so it would easily meet size and weight guidelines. She replied that it has to fit UNDER THE SEAT and my case would not (even though it meets Lufthansa's dimension requirements). I asked about the overhead compartment and she stated that ‰ÛÏonly small parcels and clothing can go in the overhead compartment.‰Û THIS IS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION OF ALL OTHER EXPERIENCES WE HAVE HAD ON FLIGHTS and we are very frequent flyers (two or three trips to Europe each year). EVEN LUFTHANSA'S WEB PAGE ON CARRY-ON BAGGAGE SHOWS A MAN PUTTING A ROLLABOARD CASE JUST LIKE OURS IN THE OVERHEAD COMPARTMENT. The two cases the agent rejected had been with us on the Lufthansa flight from Paris to Frankfurt as well as on all our previous flights on Lufthansa, Air France, British Airways, American Airlines, Air Berlin, and Delta along with Southwest for the past 6 or 7 years. She refused to listen to us and forced us to leave the bags with her. They contained our numerous medications. We had our cell phones, our two tablets, a laptop, and cameras in the bags. We could not possibly carry everything in our hands. I asked the agent at least to weigh my case since it easily met the 8 kg limitation after I removed my laptop. She answered, ‰ÛÏWould you like an 8 kg case to fall on your head?‰Û Needless to say, we were highly stressed from the manner in which we were treated, from having to travel on a long flight without some of our medications and our cell phones and tablets and other important items. To make matters worse, we saw several dozen passengers board the plane with rollaboard cases larger than ours simply because they went through a different gate and did not deal with the maniac agent who was dealing with us.

No waiting.The Business Lounge in Frankfurt was easy to find and clean. But already in the early morning hours very busy and to find a comfortable place to sit was difficult.The choice of drinks and food has improved lately. The aircraft, an Airbus 321, was for Lufthansa standards with 7 years relatively new. The seat pitch for Business Class is very small. The seats are similar to camping chairs and do not recline significantly.The aircraft had an WIFI Entertainment system installed. Good system.As usual in Lufthansa, no welcome drink on the ground.The cold breakfast served was tiny, and no choice.As usual in Lufthansa, it is a pain to sit in the front, as constantly passengers from the Economy class visit the toilets. So there is always ""traffic"" and people standing in the corridor. Other airlines do this much better. They keep the curtain closed and ask people to visit the toilets in the area where they are sitting.The waiting time at luggage claim in Barcelona was close to 1 hours. Horrible. No Lufthansa / Star Alliance staff was visible to at least inform customers what to expect and when.Priority Luggage was delivered last.As usual with Lufthansa....nothing special.....Lufthansa style"

399811552;Lufthansa;1;31.07.16;Jul 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Hong Kong;3;1;4;3;;2;3;This flight was originally due to leave at 22.10 and was delayed 24 hours due to reasons outside the control of Lufthansa. We boarded and taxied to take off area, several planes were ahead of us and we were then told that we would have to return to the airport because the curfew had expired. On arrival we were told to leave the aircraft and walk to the exit and someone would look after us. No one did. We waited with the, we were told, over 7,000 passengers and told nothing. There was one member of your staff at Information and she left (I don‰Ûªt blame her). The flight crew departed and the few security that were there called the police and they did an amazing job in calming the situation. Shortly after the police arrived some mineral water and chocolate bars arrived. Some people in pink jackets arrived and handed out more water. By early morning some of the toilets were not working very well and at one stage passengers were handing out tissues for the toilets.There were people with very small children, one we spoke to only had one bottle of water for her tiny baby. No information was given until FOUR of your staff arrived at 6.15 to face a queue that stretched the full length of the area.This complaint is not about the delay, that was not the fault of Lufthansa, but the lack of care, consideration and dignity given to your passengers who were forced in many cases to sit on the floor with no information about what was to happen. Many of these people were not young and sitting on the floor was very difficult and the children were very tired and upset. At 6.40am we were able to escape to the Business Class Lounge where the staff organised our forward trip.We also felt sorry for your staff (who were very helpful on all our flights) who had to face all the tired and angry passengers.We were told that Lufthansa is a well trained organisation and customer service was very good, you certainly failed us.Your staff on our flight to Hong Kong could not have been more helpful.We realise that bookings out of Australia are a small number, but word of mouth advertising is the best or worst type of advertising, and word can move fast.We will not test your service again.
399788452;Lufthansa;2;31.07.16;Jul 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Osaka;3;1;5;2;5;2;5;"This flight did not meet our expectations, neither the level of service and the food nor the design of the business class. First the design of business class gives you little or no privacy as you are sitting almost as close to the next passenger as you do in economy class. The whole area of business class is simply wide open. See pictures. The bed is not straight when adjusting it for sleeping position, head being higher than your legs. With one WC for the the whole upper level on this plane, it was no sign on the wall to tell us if it was occupied or not. Even walking up to the door you could not tell if it was occupied. Each time having to push on the door to see if it was in use, was an annoying experience. When it came to breakfast we were told first that she could only offer the Japanese menu. The tone of the stewardess was so special at she was staring at us for several seconds waiting and looking for our response. I said ""thank you"" and my wife said she preferred only a cup of coffee and did not want the Japanese alternative. After some time time she came with the Japanese alternative for me, being the last one to be served, and coffee for my wife. Now the stewardess was saying that she could offer my wife breakfast from the economy class, which my wife accepted. I was not offered the same. The menu onboard is saying that ""Between meals at any time we serve beverages and light snacks. The only thing served on this flight between the two meals was small plastic glasses of water (not cold) and tiny small dishes of fresh fruit and alternatively 3 small pieces of cheese - ""all"" available in complete darkness. I had to use the light from my phone to see what it was. No crackers, no nuts no chips no coke or soft drinks of any kind. I have had better serving on similar flights in economy class. I will, however, first of all remember the low level of service and bad behavior from the stewardess on this flight. She was even telling me after serving the 3 course meal after take off that ""you look so hungry, what else can I serve you""? I do not know why she said it because I had both cheese and fresh fruit after the starter and the main course. I just answered, ""no thank you"". When I later raised my hand to give her a sign that I wanted something (a glass of water) she said loudly from a distance of 1 1/2 meter ""I am here now"" , and looked irritating at me. Later when I raised my empty glass (for more water) she took my glass, did not ask any question and did not come back with my glass. 5 minutes later I went in the back to get a glass of water myself. So much went wrong on this flight, the stewardess must have had a bad day on work. Lufthansa should and could do better than this. Lufthansa Carsten Spohr give me some hope saying in the magazine on board that Lufthansa this year will get one new aircraft per week, among others the Airbus 350 - an ultra modern long-haul airplane. He did not say anything on sending the stewardesses on a service seminar, some of them is in urgent need of it."

It is very obvious that greed and -probably- bad management are affecting the passenger satisfaction. Talking about food: portions are smaller and worst quality.This judgement is by observation only, i do not consume ""plastic"" food served on the planes.Talking about human factor: Flight attendants looks very unfriendly and pissed off - for no apparent reason. I strongly suggest them to find other job if not happy with current one. Whatever problems lay behind this weird behavior should not affect passengers. Is it management pressure, is it low salary or wrong persons in this position? I don`t know and frankly i don`t care. I don`t need a pissed off lady to look like she`s making a big favor to me every time she`s asked something. Talking about tech stuff and comfort: No problems during a long flight, i was surprised - and pleased- to find some classic movies on the menu and some nice music.Airline industry is going down in quality. They apply the concept: cheap, bad services, affordable for everybody.I almost can compare this with cruise industry where disaster is more obvious.So, in conclusion: If they`re not on strike (that`s a habit for now) you can use their services, if you`re not paying attention to details or human factor and if you have no other alternative."

I believe it is an airline that you pay more, for not so much more, but for the fact that you know what to expect! Everything seems to be working as you would expect it the German way, although there have been upsets that were nevertheless dealt with satisfactorily. The economy seat room and comfort is overall average and not too small or too big. The food is average to good. Beer or wine is offered in the economy seat even for intra-European flights.The personnel is satisfactorily polite (professionally I would say) but there is normally no warmth as you ofcourse would expect from a North European. There have been nevertheless some exceptions, due to mainly second generation immigrants that have a different idiosyncrasy. Check-in is always fast and professional as well, there are many times request to strictly bring on the plane one bag only due to full flights and the luggage space many times is not enough for all who request help from the attendants to find a spot for their luggage. Greeks should know that when they land to Frankfurt or Munich they almost all the times have to get in a bus that drives for about 10 mins before getting to the terminal. The reason is of course that they are airports with high traffic and my guess is it is cheaper to not park a plane on the gate.

LH is reliable, has excellent customer service in regard of sorting out problems due to flight cancellations or delays (industrial action, weather etc.) and together with its partners a very wide international network. Some of their flight attendants make you wonder why they have chosen this job (there is usually one of them in each crew) but the others are friendly, helpful and courteous. There are just snacks and one or two rounds of drinks on short haul flights but thatå«s pretty much standard with the full service carriers nowadays. Have never used them long haul, so canå«t really say anything about that. Definitely recommend Lufthansa for short haul flights.

The Airplanes and Lounges are impeccable, with excellent food and even showers if you feel you need one at no additional cost at their Gold Lounges. It is my favorite airline.

This was only my second flight with Lufthansa, and now that I am living in Frankfurt, it is the logical choice. The cost difference for Premium Economy was not that great, and definitely worth the price. The larger seat, more legroom, larger TV screen, welcome-aboard drink, and more personal service are great. Having real silverware to eat with was a definite plus. I won't fly Coach class again on a long-haul flight, and I am very happy with Lufthansa!
396433560;Lufthansa;3;24.07.16;Jul 16;0;Europe;Business Class;Frankfurt;Belgrade;3;3;3;3;;1;3;Lufthansa, was always my preferred carried, but this past 12 months it has begun to over price tickets and cut back of the quality of service. They are losing Euro BC business to other carriers who have switched to 2+2 and who's ticket prices are as much as 30% cheaper. This flight was short just over an hour, but you could see the flight crew where there but the interest was not there. Lufthansa Business Lounge has gone from being a trend setter to (sorry to say) a has been. Very limited food and drink. For once German high standards have been lost.
395939723;Lufthansa;4;23.07.16;Jul 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Philadelphia;2;4;4;3;4;3;2;This our second time flying with Lufthansa. We were seated towards the middle of the widebody aircraft A340-300 Economy Class. The on-board service was above average, friendly, and generous. This is something that you rarely get nowadays flying in economy class. The flight attendants were approachable and always had a smile in their face. There were no attitudes and no negativity compared to most American airline operators. Lavatories were always kept clean and well stocked with amenities. The aircraft was clean and had a pillow and blanket readily available on each seat as we boarded. The meals were average but were hot and were served with silverware not plastic. The flight attendants kept you hydrated by offering drinks and water several times. They also offer wine for free. Headsets are also available for free. The overall flight was smooth and efficient. The only downside is the boarding process in Frankfurt where people boarded the plane regardless of their seat number. The gate agents were replaced by an automated gate where you scan your boarding pass. After which, you will proceed to a set of stairs to go downstairs where a bus is waiting to transport passengers to the airplane parked somewhere in the middle of the airport. We were not expecting this and it was not a comfortable process. I feel bad for those who have mobility problems or for those who are traveling with children and have carry-ons. The seats on this plane were also not comfortable.

394112738;Lufthansa;4;18.07.16;Jun 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Los Angeles;4;4;5;2;5;3;2;Paying for transatlantic premium economy gets you more legroom, slightly wider seats, nicer service for meals, but not much else of value. On the 747-800, it's shared with a normal economy cabin, where there was always--always--a line for the 2 restrooms. The 4 center seats are arranged so the two middle ones have supports right in the middle of your footwell, so there's really no place to put any stuff. Or your feet. No priority boarding, and not necessarily one of the first ones off the plane, either (right side of the 747 exits first, left side waits for business class.) Generally, the experience is a notch below US domestic first class. Worth miles or an upgrade? Sure. Worth paying cash money for? Tough call.

As with AC there is no real separation from the main Economy cabin. The LH seats are a little narrower and I found not as comfortable by the time we were halfway through our 10 hour flight. LH ""won"" over AC with their very attentive, friendly service even thought the plane was stuffed to the rafters. I thought their entertainment system was easier to use, with a bigger screen than AC but had a lot of german-centric content (which makes sense). A previous contributor commented on LH being a world class airline which I agree with - moreso than AC. All in all, a good, comfortable flight and as we booked well in advance, the price was good value."

When I arrived to the airport I was told that my seat was upgraded to business class. This was one of the best flying experiences I ever had. Before the flight you get access to their lounge which is simply amazing as well. You get nonstop food, snacks, beverages and the best part - draft beer. Afterwards you go directly to the gate from the lounge which saves you the line and everything. The seat itself was amazing (it was a new 747-8) and you can extend it to 180 degrees when you want to sleep. The service was amazing and the food was great. The personal TV is enormous and you get everything you need in your travel kit.
393694303;Lufthansa;2;17.07.16;Jul 16;0;Europe;Business Class;Frankfurt;Strasbourg;4;2;5;1;1;;1;I know I didn't find any information when I needed, so I hope this review will be useful to somebody. Just to make it clear -- I'm reviewing the Lufthansa Express BUS service, not the airline or the flight, but the ticket was bought through the LH (part airplane, part bus).So after landing at FRA (where I was connecting), got my boarding pass for the LH Express bus, which said 'Business' class (?). So I went to the info counter and asked what are 'business class bus seats' and the lady laughed with me and told me she had no idea. But, nevertheless, I asked her to check if this means you can wait in business lounge (since I didn't buy the ticket myself, I had no idea weather there's a regular/business bus seat to choose from). The lady called LH and checked, they said 'if it says business - than yes, no matter if it's bus'. Therefore, showed my pass and went through the business class security line with no problem and went to find the lounge. When I found it, the guy at the entrance said 'no, there is no bus business class'. By that time, i already had to get to the bus, so went to find the station.Getting to the station was an adventure. The terminology was amazingly messed up, crowded and confusing - at some places you'd see signs 'long distance buses', 'lufthansa express bus', 'lufthansa express shuttle' so plan enough time to find it and just follow 'lufthansa express bus' yellow signs.The driver arrived 15 mins earlier and sat in the bus, while the pax were waiting outside watching him play on his iPad. Few minutes before the departure, he stepped outside and just opened the cargo doors and went straight back in, while the passengers loaded all their luggage in (nice touch LH). Some of the passengers got water bottles while entering, some didn't. The ride itself was ok. Took 3.5 hours. Bus quality and seats was nice and clean as well. Free wifi was available, but incredibly slow and 'worked' only in Germany.
393313055;Lufthansa;1;16.07.16;Jul 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Atlanta;4;1;5;5;4;5;1;RE: Lufthansa disgraceful and discriminatory personnel behaviorMy husband and I have flown together and for business over three hundred times, and never have had a complaint about service from any airline. Now things are different.We left Bucharest airport on July 12 on a flight to Frankfurt at 6:20 am to arrive on time in Frankfurt, Germany on time at 7:45 am.In Bucharest they offered my husband the wheel chair he ordered, but it was few steps to the plane, so we walked.Upon arriving in Frankfurt, our next flight was at 10:20 am, boarding at 9:35 am. There was no wheelchair service and we were told LUFTHANSA determined he did not need one. What, they decided?? DO they know him and why he needs a wheelchair??Ok, it only gets worse.About ten minutes later a cart arrived and we boarded it for a three minute ride to an office where we were told to sit and wait, it would be a few minutes. No one would help us. They just keep telling us to sit down.30 minutes later, were went through a passport check and were put on a bus. No wheel chair and no help. We sat on the bus until 9:30 am, even the bus driver was upset. A number of foreign passengers in a group joined the bus and we still sat there. We still sat there. After more time, we took a ONE MINUTE bus ride from terminal A to Terminal Z and were let out. There we had to find our gate, 16, we arrived way after priority boarding, it was now 10:04 a.m. The lady at the counter was the first nice person we met at the airport. I told her what was going on and I needed to use the restroom for two minutes. I came back, she took us by elevator to another bus to go to the tarmac for the plane. We stood. It was the last bus for the flight. At the plane, there were almost THIRTY steps up the staircase to the door. We were dragging our little under the seat bags. At the last five steps, a steward came out and offered to help my husband. I was in tears. They asked me if I was all right and I said no. As soon as we sat down the door shut. We were the last passengers on the plane. This is disgraceful behavior on the part of the LUFTHANSA airlines, to treat a handicapped person as they did. My husband walks with two canes. We ordered the service months ago and reconfirmed the service the day of our flights. What happened???? I want answers. This is terrible behavior for an airline. WE will not fly on Lufthansa again, believe me, I rather stay home. Now I can sit and wait and probably NEVER get a response from the Airline, after all, if they did not care anyway, why would I expect a response. We travel several times a year, believe me, you will never see us on a Lufthansa flight again.
393257685;Lufthansa;5;16.07.16;Jun 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;San Francisco;4;5;;;5;5;;Other airlines should pay attention to the level of service that Lufthansa provides and mimic it. Not only were the staff happy and pleasant, they paid extra attention to those traveling with children. We were one of them. Prior to take off we were given a deck of cards and paper airplanes to assemble. When the meals were being served and the pasta meals were running low, our flight attendant went to every family with a child and asked them first if they wanted the pasta before it got scooped up by the adult masses. This was the first time I've experienced this and thanked her profusely. It's these simple touches and attention that makes a 12 hour flight bearable.
392868502;Lufthansa;1;15.07.16;Jun 16;1;Europe;Business Class;Frankfurt;Athens;2;5;3;3;1;3;1;The experience with Lufthansa was not the best. It all started by the booking which we did through United NOT knowing that we were going to end up flying lufthansa. We were traveling business, so, we would had expected to be able to choose our seats etc... which we weren't able to do so, and found out that it is quite a hassle to do so because of the airline's policies, which weren't specified anywhere in the United website. I realized that we didn't have assigned seat when I went to do the check in!Then we went to the airport, and got the seat assigned and miraculously we were able to seat together (I was traveling with another three family members). After we departed from Chicago, and got to Frankfurt, then the hassle and the disorganized experience began. The boarding process from Frankfurt to Athens was one of the most disorganized that I had ever experienced. People didn't respect the lines, they passed you by even when there were a clear line formed. The airline, had a preferred boarding process for infants etc, that were worth less because you board into a bus that takes you to the airplane to board. After we got in the bus, then we could board through two different doors, so you got people boarding from the back to the airplane that had seats at the front! It was total caos and a nightmare. That goes without saying that the special boarding passengers had to compete in order to get into the plane and have their carryon in the bin compartment. The flight was really good and so was the service on board. But, the boarding process needs to be significantly improved. I would never flight lufthansa again and/or I would never do a transfer in europe from the states just to avoid this chaotic situation.

Plane was a 747-400 and to my surprise business class in lower deck was almost empty. We were maximum 8-10 people in the entire section. Had checked in on seat 2A but could have chosen any seat i liked as we were very few people. Senior stewardess greeted me with my last name and in general service was extremely personalized regardless of having star alliance gold status or not. food was very good for an airline. my glass was always full of whatever i was drinking. its not the first time i fly business, but it was the first time in an almost empty plane. flight was smooth and arrived at MCO almost on time, despite having a delay in FRA.

But shortly after the meal was served, the woman in the seat in front of me reclined her seat and sent my food tray flying into my lap. As if having the food dumped rather unceremoniously all over me, my beverage went the same way leaving me rather wet. The cabin crew didn't appear to care or even know what to do about it. However 6 hours later when we were flying alongside the Himalayas the certainly knew how to tell me to lower the window blind. A perfect day for admiring the scenery, and I had paid extra for the window seat, then not permitted to look out that window.

As we were taxing to the runway for takeoff, the head flight attendant asked if there was a doctor on board.I raised my hand and she took me to a patient who suffers from emphysema and was having problems with an oxygen tank that Lufthansa provided for him. I was able to resolve the problem and then spoke with the co-pilot who wanted to know if they could takeoff or return to the terminal.I informed him the patient was stable and he could resume takeoff. I checked on the patient once more as we were crossing the Atlantic. He was comfortable.My shock was that no one from the airline was appreciative for my services, even though I probably saved them a bundle of money with my decision to resume takeoff. No thanks from any representative from this airline. The patient was appreciative and we left on time. That's what countsI

Generally, US airlines board from the back of the plane by rows. However, the flight seemed to board much faster than US airlines. Whether this is the result of German citizens knowing what is expected of them and complying with ""the rules"" or some other reason, I was pleasantly surprised that boarding (a full flight) was very smooth. In flight service was fast and efficient too. I wish all of my flight experiences were like this one."

Flight attendants are highly skilled and very efficient. Leg room and space in general is fine if the person in front does not lower the back of his/hear seat. Recently they started charging 25 EUR for reserving the seat and gave up the possibility to check-in online 23 hours in advance. 23 kg baggage allowance for overseas flights is pretty generous.

I was on the shuttle bus from the Frankfurt airport to a hotel (Park Inn - they have issues too). Two rows behind me was a Lufthansa captain, you know with those 4 stripes on his sleeves, and one of his flight attendants. They were talking freely about the United States and then a couple of profanities slipped in. Since this is a family type site I will leave it to your imagination. I am a proud American and I will not allow anyone to insult my country like that in public. I challenged them on their comments and like the cowardly dogs that they are, they denied it and quickly asserted that they liked the US. I flew to Germany on Lufthansa because I am fed up with US carriers but after this, it will be only US carriers to Europe (don't know if I will be back to Germany as in the last two weeks I have had enough German rudeness to last a lifetime - BTW my Mom was German and my Dad was first generation German American for the politically correct types). Believe me, I was ready to respond with a few barbs based on their tainted history but bit my tongue for the most part.nAs much as American carriers suck on their service, at least they don't insult one's country in public.

This made for a better sleep quality and some extra stowage space. Service was OK, but not excellent. I suppose the very amount of people on board makes it a tough proposition to offer good service in coach. In-flight entertainment was very good.

The ""task force"" was a line of over two hours to get a voucher for hotel + taxi and a rebooking the next day on the same flight. It is ridiculous that an airline like Lufthansa cannot face a situation like that with more professionalism. There was no reason to wait two additional hours to get a simple voucher that could have been already printed and ready when we landed. Absolutely ridiculous."

While these seats are much better I am struggling with the sleep comfort.

What I also Love with Lufthansa is that you got free TV all the time and also free drinks including alcohol. They bring you also food and it taste for plane food pretty good. Also already the service at the airport is super. They answer you every questions. The plane also looks safe and clean! and the Chairs are pretty comfortable too.The take off and landing are amazing it just feels like Bus riding. Okay that depends also on the pilot and weather. But i prefer to pay a bit more and take Lufthansa than any other airline. I feel save and taken care off in a plane of Lufthansa.

The Plane was very silent and gave a calm flight.The Food wasnå«t so exciting (i guess german food is not my thing) and didnt also like the German Beer.. So food was a disapointment.entertainment was ok/good screen at each seatWould only use Lufthansa if they where the cheapest, Asian Airlines is much better fx Singapoore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Thai Airways. I would prefear them even if they cost a bid more.

378552706;Lufthansa;3;01.06.16;Nov 15;7;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Hong Kong;3;4;3;4;5;3;5;I know strikes aren't in their control zone, but we planned our holiday months before, booked our hotels and tours, and in the last week the staff decided to go on strike and it ruined all of our plans. The flight got cancelled and that's it. Our payment for the hotel was non refundable and of course it was lost. The company offered a free replanning of our flight and we cut one week from our vacation. The flight itself was nice. It was on time, the plane was ok, food ok, lots of free movies on board, but still, the vacation was meant to get us relaxed and leave the stress behind. We got the opposite. Lost money and lots of stress because they didn't know if the strike would continue for the second week and we were stressed until we saw the plane take off.I would like to buy a ticket and be sure that my flight will be exactly when planned, without surprises. I hope this is a unique situation and our next flights will go more smoothly.

Even on a short-haul flight a snack of some type is served. Have been upgraded to their Business Class cabin several times and have enjoyed their excellent service. Comfortable seating, and a delicious snack or meal. LH is certainly treated me nicely while on board their aircraft.

On my flight last year 26.12 I even got an upgrade to Business Class just before boarding a plane which was a real surprise and my first Business Class experience ever on a plane. The service and food on the flight were great and it is nice to have the seat next to you free so you can stretch your legs a bit more.All the staff I experienced on the ground and in the air have always been great!!!I know I will continue to fly Lufthansa and are looking into in a long haul flight with them but that probably won't be till next year.

The flight attendants were rude and impolite. We had already ordered for Asian Vegetarian meal - they served us - they have changed the food items in all our three lunch plates - may be the items were exhausted. But they did not ask us about our choice and just included cheese, french dressing etc which we did not like. On top of this , they served the lunch at about `1600 hrs - very late.They were giving rude replies when we asked for water even when there was no activity at all. At one time 4 to 5 flight attendants were carrying Masala tea and crowding near one row- without any meaning. The flight attendants need a good training to improve the service - at least to the level of our Indian Domestic flight attendants.Overall, the experience was not a memorable one. I would prefer any other airlines in future.Krishnan, RGoa. India

Very efficient, runs on time and gets the job done !But unlike Asian or Middle Eastern airlines, do not expect a lot of service, great food or extra leg room in the cabin. Also, LH usually does not give you a complimentary upgrade even if you ask for it (I have received multiple upgrades in other airlines).

Please accept our sincere apologies for our delayed reply. We are currently experiencing a high volume of feedbacks from our customers.""Lufthansa's answer is the problem. From an airline that takes pride in service and respects their customers it became another low end airline that competes with price, an price only. The customer is their last concern. They are not the only ones but don't expect much more from them.In my case I tried to cooperate with their request to check in my handbag since the plain is full (don't expect much room in their flights). I was trying to be a good Samaritan. BIG MISTAKE, NEVER COOPERATE WITH LUFTHANSA IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO! I gave them my knapsack, but told them it is breakable and they should put it in my suitcase or somewhere safe. The lady in the counter took it and put it aside. When I asked her if she is going to put it in my suitcase she said no, it goes in as it is. I told her that in that case I would need it back since there is breakable stuff inside. She refused. I told her that in that case I would need a confirmation that they know it is breakable and they took it against my will. She refused. To have any kind of proof in case things start to break I recorded my request. The lady ran away and called a baggage handler by the name of Mueller to bully and intimidate me not taking the proof. The guy started screaming at me ""this is Germany here, this is Germany"". Being German I found it pathetic and disturbing, but I guess this is what you can expect when you let baggage handlers face customers. It ended with the manager finally arriving, causing the baggage handler to run away and giving me my knapsack back. At least the manager acted professionally.In case you are wondering, it is more than three month now, and I never heard back from Lufthansa."

During my last trip I discovered that a trip, invoiced to Lufthansa, but done with another vendor doesn't collect the same miles..........Unbelieveble but true!!! The flight ticket didn't cost less than buying one operated by Lufhansa but they recognize you less miles............. I have asked at the Lufthansa operator why they do that. The answer was to push people to use Lufthansa planes insteadn than the other partners. Sorry Lufthansa but I'm a Sales Manager and it is really difficult for me to understand your policy because at the end of this story my mood is to leave your company and try a new partener for my next flights.Sometime this small things can make your customer more happy if managed on a different way...........

I had to sit with my back to one of the toilet walls and had not enough space for my legs. When I flew with them again to get some surgeries in Germany done, I was so unlucky that i couldn't fly back as i thought, because of an bacterial infection I had gotten from the German hospital. I'd almost lost my leg, my family waiting for me in Thailand, etc...The doctor who implanted an artificial knee joint wrote a doctor's note and was certain that a company like Lufthansa would of course give me the chance through those circumstances to fly back three weeks later. I finally received an e-mail that it wouldn't be possible,but i could buy a new ticket from them. Thanks to Lufthansa that i had to sell my big bike in Thailand to be able to buy another plane ticket. But never ever with Lufthansa.  I swear by god.

The ground staff, told us to mention it to the flight attendant, which we did. OMG - it was an unbelievably special occasion for my daughter. The captain announced it was her birthday (she turned 11), the whole plane clapped for her, and overtime he made an announcement, he mentioned her name (ladies and gentlemen, and the special birthday girl, -----). They then gave her small gifts, as well as the captain invited my daughter to the flight deck when we landed. It was such an amazing experience, in this day and age, for an airline as big as LH to make a flight such a memorable event. Thank you so much.

367784762;Lufthansa;4;26.04.16;Apr 16;0;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Los Angeles;3;5;;;1;2;;"I'd heard for years about the exceptional experiences flying on European air carriers. Usually the comments were in the same breath about how horrible US carriers are and ""they could take a page from the Europeans.""I traveled to Europe, LAX- BEG (Belgrade) in March on United (to Munich) and Star Alliance partner Lufthansa (Munich/Belgrade). The UAL experience was awesome. Business Class seating in individual pods was comfortable and cozy, private too. Service was excellent, media/entertainment offerings current and very good.There's not an option to return to Los Angeles on UAL from Munich or Frankfurt so I booked Lufthansa Business Class on an Airbus 380 (the giant slave ship).Check in/boarding- I travel with the most elite UAL status, past 1K and had hoped for some sort of pre boarding love from the Star Alliance partner. No luck. Instead there was a uncoordinated scrum of a queue that blobbed, snaked and strectched into the terminal pedestrian flow as passengers squeezed for a chance at 2 narrow chutes for boarding card swipe, access and entry. No Bueno!Seating- I'm not a fan of Airbus equipment. Don't like the features on the A319/320 and was curious/excited to fly on the 380, the GIGANTIC double decker. I assumed for the pretty much exclusive First/Business Class upper deck amenities and service would be superlative, especially on a Euro carrier and Lufthansa. The seats were narrow. There was no privacy like the Boeing pods on United. Instead the passenger next to me shifted, ate, read, turned on/off in plain view. On a 12 hour flight I would rather some sense of a little cave.Media- The media player system is horrible. Firstly, the viewing screen/monitor is an OLD , dim display that's mounted far from the seat. It's hard to see, the image quality is horrible. The controls are on a little, tethered remote with barely intuitive symbols. Worse, WORSE is there's not an option to use personal audio device! There's no headphone jack which means noise cancelling devices are useless to watch media. Instead the Bose overear phones are permanently wired and that's all there is. By the way, do they ever clean the headphones and earpads? Yuck.Entertainment - TV and Movie options were anemic. Lufthansa is clearly saving $$$ licensing old, stale movies and television. Live TV options were Football (soccer) only. Dumb.Food and Cabin Service- Food was pretty average to terrible. That said, there was plenty of it on the 12 hour journey. Flight attendants were attentive, thorough, polite and professional.Conclusion- Given the chance I'll look for a flight through another Euro city and connect to UAL back to the USA. Service and equipment are better than this Lufthansa experience."

There was good entertainment program on the monitors for the kids, so the time vers spent looking at Disney, or Playing games.The seats are not the most comfortable, but all in all, a good flight, and not to expensive.

Flight attendants were fabulous. Seats in Economy were cramped on this long haul flight but made up for by the fabulous staff, great in flight entertainment and the great take off camera that allows you to watch the plane taking off. Terrific map option on entertainment that was akin to Google Maps allowing you to really see where exactly you were flying at any given time. As with many passengers, man in front of me put his seat back all the way so I could not eat or get up to go to the bathroom - my kudos to Lufthansa who asked ALL passengers in Economy class to put their seats upright for meal times so that everyone can eat comfortably. YEAH! Never ever heard that before and so appreciated. Passengers should be more courteous to those sitting behind them on long haul flights. We are all tired but some of us don't sleep and need to be able to get in and out of our seats. A380 was quiet, smooth, a great airplane.

There were so many movies available that I didn't even get a chance to fall asleep. We had two meals on board, and they were pretty good considering it was airplane food.

361044341;Lufthansa;3;02.04.16;Mar 16;1;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;New York;;;;;;;;Lufthansa has come into the third age, 60 years after restart they have lost the dynamics to be a real market leader, The pricing is definitely more then a jungle, the service is something between the approach of having been once upon a time a three star restaurant in the air and trying now to serve standard canteen food , declared as high class.Lufthansa definitely needs to copy the service of leading other airlines to learn the lesson.To copy or exceed the price level is not the solution.The so called flat beds in business are flat( what a surprise!) but the designer seemed to have designed beds for dwarfs before, when it comes to the width.even Swiss or Austrian are in all means superior .

Rolled it on the plane to Franfurt, but was stopped by the gate agent on the way home. Note the roll-aboard was even less full coming home to Denver. They have a sizing frame the size of a shoebox in Frankfurt, and the wheels did not fit into the sizer. I really nicely tried to ask if It was OK, but nope : Gate check.In the plane multiple oversized bins ( Like the one it easily fit into going over where empty). Upon arrival In Denver I waited an hour for the bag. Note: First luggage off the plane is the crews, kind of sets the expectation for service that this airline is trying to deliver.

As it happened everything went smoothly and there were no issues, but I'm always paranoid about flying with European airlines because of high strike risk. Food was below average and entertainment was not as good as one gets used to with SQ (or even QF and CX).

Even getting up every now and then is not enoughI almost missed my flight. Lufthansa does not allow enough time to go thru a connection where you have to also clear customs. My connection allowed for 1hr 40mins. I thought that would be enough time UNTIL I had quite a walk from gate to gate with customs in between. Had it not been for that fact that I hailed a golf cart, halfway, I would've missed my flight. I ended up being the last person to board the PACKED plane. I rated this airline as I did because they waited for me AND because they served cognac and Bailey's at no charge. There's a USB port in the armrest but it's hidden so you might have to ask where it is. The progress of the flight on your personal TV screen on the seat in front of you was a big plus. There were even cameras on the plane's tail so as to view the landing with the same vantage point as the pilots'.

I had a bulk seat (front seats where they give you baby carriage) on the way to Frankfurt no problem. I called in one month advance to reserve the bulk seat again and I was told no problem. When I entered the plane I realized that I was placed in the back somewhere with a baby on my lap. When I complained, they moved me to the bulk seats. An hour into the flight captan came and called me a liar in front of everyone. Said you never reserved these seats. If there was a way to stop to plane, I would have get off the plane. He didn't believe me and asked for the person's name who made the reservation. How could I remember from a month ago? Who takes the name of the clerk who made the reservation anyway? He actually expected me to travel with a baby in my lap for 11 hours. They have no common sense.
351329106;Lufthansa;5;27.02.16;Aug 15;6;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Chicago;5;5;;;5;4;;I have used Lufthansa for my international flights for many years and many times. I wrote several reviews about them on their questionnaires, but not on the TripAdvisor, since I just found out I can do so.In my experience, Lufthansa is one of the best airlines in the world. They fly newer aircraft, their crew and in-flight service is highly professional and top rate. Inside the airplane everything is clean and sparkling. When you enter the Business Class cabin -- you immediately know you are going to have a good time.The cabin is nicely ventilated during the whole flight. The seats in Business Class are very comfortable, only two seats on the left or the right side of the aircraft, and four in the center section, if it is the 747, with plenty of leg room. The flight attendants help you with jackets which they hang for you in a special closet. The individual remote control unfolds the seat almost horizontally, if you want to sleep. You are provided with an individual vanity kit with toiletries, and some high-quality bottled water. A lot of magazines/newspapers to read. In-flight Duty Free shopping service. The TV sets are mounted individually for each passenger at an individual angle , so that you won't disturb the passenger seating next to you. So if you don't want to sleep -- watch any kind of programs and contemporary movies they offer in abundance. At the top of the salon they also have bigger screen TVs with the flight info (distance, cruising speed, mileage, outside temperature) and the world map on which they constantly show how the flight progresses.The cleanliness , even during such a long flight, is not an issue: if something is not clean, they clean it for you right away.Several meals and various drinks are served during the long flights. Free of charge, of course. The menu is fantastic, the quality of food is excellent. When asked about their meals I usually comment, without flattery, that the Lufthansa Business Class meals are very often much better than those on the ground, in some places. And this is true.The flight attendants are trained to perfection -- they are ultimately knowledgeable, attentive, friendly, smiling, easy-going and accommodating. For example, if you don't know which of the two appetizers, offered on the menu, you'd like to order -- they might bring you both (which they did for me), just to try, you know. How about that for a customer service! During the flight they also offer extra water or juices, ice cream (!), etc. Of course, all this is free of charge.Each time I fly overseas and back I try to book the Lufthansa -- the experience of flying nine hours with such a perfect service is totally worth trying and enjoying. Danke Schoen, Lufthansa! Sie sind die Beste!

350842067;Lufthansa;5;25.02.16;Jan 16;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Delhi;;;;;;;;We flew from Frankfurt to Delhi and were completely satisfied by the services provided. The food provided was good in taste and they do take care for vegetarian and children.
349821416;Lufthansa;4;21.02.16;Feb 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Chicago;4;4;;;4;4;;I love Lufthansa, German punctualaty and unbeatable prices. On my way back to Chicago I was surprised to find out that men's restrooms of Frankfurt airport were very small, overcrowded and one of the three nearby was out of order. Very inconvenient. Can the airport do something about that?
349679863;Lufthansa;5;21.02.16;Mar 15;11;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Rio de Janeiro;4;5;;;5;4;;I took the evening flight from Frankfurt & flew solo to Brazil.I felt very secure during the flight, we were extremely well looked after, food was good, toilets were at a different level- so no unpleasant smells coming out in the corridor & toilets were spotless. Small tv was in the seat in front of me, we were offered chocolates in the middle of the night and there was a station where you could help yourself with water. Also there is a more roomy mum/baby toilet which was allocated at the back end of the isles, which meant I was able to change into fresh cloths prior to landing. We were rewarded with a stunning sun rise as the airplane was descending to land. I would not hesitate flying long hall again with Lufthansa.
348345693;Lufthansa;4;16.02.16;Feb 16;0;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Osaka;3;5;;;5;5;;I am very pleased with Lufthansa's new entertainment system. Although the plane was an older 747-400 rather than the new 747-8 they also use on this connection, the system was up-to-date. Food can be soso. I opted for a special meal (veggie) which looked much nicer than the standard. Also tasted better than the meals I had before with Lufthansa.Staff are friendly and increasingly tend to speak English as a standard.
347708151;Lufthansa;5;14.02.16;Aug 15;6;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Gdansk;4;5;;;3;5;;Good airlines with friendly service. Clean and comfy seats. The departures seems to be on time. My baggage was not lost and delivered to the destination as planned.
347656895;Lufthansa;5;14.02.16;Jan 16;1;International;Premium Economy;Frankfurt;Los Angeles;4;5;;;5;4;;Germans really know how to make everything almost to perfection. Out of many other airlines we have traveled, Lufthansa is one of the very best. It's a class of it's own. Air France, KLM are nothing in comparison.
347120618;Lufthansa;5;12.02.16;Dec 15;2;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Mexico City;3;5;;;4;5;;The return flights with Lufthansa were overall very good. The cabin crew are well trained and sorted out the problems we had on our flight. Lufthansa are reliable and we had no concerns about flying with them and would be happy to fly with them at any time in the future. My seat back screen did not work on the way out, however, this was a relatively minor issue and Lufthansa did give me and my boyfriend champagne and vouchers for duty free for the inconvenience. The supervisor also sorted out the faulty seat recline on my boyfriend's seat. There is very little room when the seats in front of you do recline, I felt quite claustrophobic. There is not enough space in economy class for seat recline, if someone in front of you reclines their seat you are very cramped and I believe the seats should not recline in economy class. However, this is not just a criticism with Lufthansa, I have the same issue with all airlines. The food was not particularly good, I am a vegetarian and these days you seem to get lumped in with vegans and get vegan food which is very unimaginative, although it is edible.
345703337;Lufthansa;4;07.02.16;Mar 15;11;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Miami;4;4;;;4;4;;Flying the Lufthansa 380 was a pleasant surprise with a nice and smooth flight for almost 8 hours. From the checking, to boarding to disembarkation, everything was smooth and simple. The service itself was pretty easy and very good with a wide range of beverages and meal options. We manage to see some of the new features of the plane and we were really happy the product itself. Crew its very friendly and chatty, and the schedule was perfect. A great choice and very good value for money.
344955323;Lufthansa;4;04.02.16;Sep 15;5;Europe;Economy;Frankfurt;Gothenborg;3;4;;;;4;;Lufthansa is a good airline if take short haule flights in Europe!usually 23kg free bagagge, a snack and friendly staff (despite LH isnå«t allways a god emplyer anymore)The fleet is modern and they fly almost allways on time!
344726436;Lufthansa;3;03.02.16;Nov 15;3;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Miami;5;3;;;3;3;;"It was a very nice trip, form Geneva to Frankfurt the flight was nice good breakfast friendly crew. In Frankfurt I had a stop at the lounge which was also nice with a lot of different food, I had a glass or two of sparkling wine (there was no champagne). And I had also a cigarette in the special area for smoker. Free WiFi. The Lounge however was crowded and I don't like that. Boarding was a bit messy since my boarding pass showed a gate that was not right and I had to rush some ten gates away to get on board.I booked a window seat, when on board I found a lady sitting at my place. She asked me if she could travel next to her friend and if I would be ok to take her seat which was an aisle seat one row ahead. I was really not happy with that since the space at the window is much comfortable than the aisle. As a gentleman I agree. During the flight I find out that both were staff member traveling with free tickets!! Not nice. About the seat it is a great seat with many possibilities it can be set to a full flat bed. Massage option and a lot of space to put your hand luggage lap top, and so on. The food was ok I must say that it was not really mouth-watering when you saw it. But it was good. Champagne was good too however after a few hours I was told there was no more champagne and only sparkling wine?!! What about children traveling with their family in business class and in fact they seemed also to be staff member. Respect for other passenger would be not to let the child run the aisle even if Mum and Dad are tired to keep their child quiet by playing hundreds of stupid games...disturbing all the cabin. I must say that when you travel on airlines with first class the business class is really lower than an airline like Austrian with no first class. Since Lufthansa must sell first class ticket their business class is ..so ..so. Austrian put a first class service in business class! One word about the Airbus 380 I enjoyed flying with since you arrive to your destination in very good shape. In fact the level of humidity is artificially maintained to a normal level...so your body don't get dehydrated. An other great point is the low level of noise. And finally I appreciated the WiFi that allowed me to call home and to talk to my friend on whats app during the whole flight. An other great thing was the camera showing the outside: we were able to follow the landing until we get on the ground which was really impressive. I think that Lufthansa should define a behavior policy for their staff when traveling on free ticket. It is not to paying passenger to undergo staff issue on board. I rate this airline/ this flight ""average"" since flying Austrian Business class was an extraordinary experience, Lufthansa did not give me this feeling of outstanding service."
343877256;Lufthansa;3;30.01.16;Mar 15;10;International;Business Class;Frankfurt;Vancouver;4;3;;;3;3;;I don't normally go out of my way to fly LH, but they do have good rewards availability with Aeroplan. I have flown a couple long haul flights out of Frankfurt and Munich. The crusty 747-400 with old-style recliner business class seats out of FRA was good enough for a daytime flight, and the novelty of row 1 (ahead of the pilot and nose wheel) was pretty neat. The A330-300 with updated flatbed business class seat out of Munich was more in keeping with similar offerings on the market and a perfectly good product. Frankfurt airport felt as pleasant as a bus stop though Munich was noticeably more inviting. I have read reviews praising to high heavens the service level of LH first class, but my own experience with LH business class has been rather pedestrian. The lounges have been Ikea-sterile and quite crowded, and onboard service largely indifferent though catering have been more than acceptable. I hope to be proven wrong one day, but my general experience with LH so far has been rather lacklustre and underwhelming compared to competitors (even that of the same corporate family, e.g. Swiss LX).
343623595;Lufthansa;5;29.01.16;Oct 15;3;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Delhi;5;5;;;4;5;;One of the BEST Global Airlines, Lufthansa exceeded my expectations. Discounting the nominal experience at the terminal at FRA, and only counting the memories on board the aircraft, I would fly Lufthansa again, any day! A brand new A380 for the flight from FRA to DEL, I enjoyed to the fullest magnificence of the upper deck economy class (Yes, Lufthansa is one of the very few airlines, if not the only airline, that offers economy in the upper deck). Wide legroom, spacious, spotless clean and fresh! I especially enjoyed the blue dim lighted staircase that leads from the fist deck to the upper desk, very romantic and soothing!IFE selection was fascinating, new bigger interactive screen with crisp sound. Wide selection of English and other language movies/series/music. Food was another thing to commend about, it was delicious (much so for airline food), I had the chicken option, and German pastry. Beverages (both alcoholic and non) were served frequently. Professional and courteous and approachable air crews - my seat's port for iphone was not working and I asked if I could use the business class (which was just on the other side of my seat) seat port to charge my phone - she readily agreed to allow me to use their business class!This was a fascinating experience with me, first on board an A380 (that also in the upper deck). Very welld one Lufthansa!

342635870;Lufthansa;1;25.01.16;Dec 15;1;International;Economy;Frankfurt;Hong Kong;3;3;;;4;1;;Same terrible returned flight experiences. Foods they served were terrible, breads-hard and COLD. And they served a never ending waters. Never ever book again with this airline.
